<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<h4>Renewing the Sectional Struggle</h4>
<h4>1848-1854</h4>
<hr />
<p><b>The Popular Sovereignty Panacea</b></p>
<p>
  <strong>Popular Sovereignty:</strong> the idea that the people of a territory
  should determine their territory's status of slavery. It was popular with
  politicians because it was a compromise between the abolitionists and the
  slaveholders.
</p>
<p>
  At the Democratic National Convention at Baltimore, the
  <strong> Democrats</strong> chose <u>General Lewis Cass</u>, a veteran of the
  war of 1812, as their candidate for presidency.&nbsp; Cass was not against
  slavery; he supported popular sovereignty.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Political Triumphs for General Taylor</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>Whigs</b>, who met in Philadelphia, chose <u>Zachary Taylor</u> as
  their candidate for presidency.&nbsp; Taylor did not have an official stance
  on slavery, but he did own many slaves.&nbsp; Henry Clay had not been chosen
  because he had too many enemies.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>Free Soil </strong><strong>Party</strong> was created by
  antislavery men of the North who didn't trust Cass or Taylor.&nbsp; They
  supported federal aid for internal improvements.&nbsp; They argued that with
  slavery, wage labor would wither away and with it, the chance for the American
  worker to own property.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Zachary Taylor</u> won the <b>election of 1848</b> (sworn into office in
  1849).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>"Californy Gold"</b></p>
<p>
  In <strong>1848</strong>, gold was discovered in California.&nbsp; The influx
  of people associated with the <strong>California gold rush</strong> brought
  violence and disease that overwhelmed the small Californian government.&nbsp;
  Needing protection, the Californians bypassed the territorial stage of a
  state, drafted their own <strong>Constitution</strong> (<strong
    >excluding slavery</strong
  >) in <strong>1849</strong>, and applied to Congress for admission into the
  Union.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The southerners objected to California's admission as a free state because it
  would be upset the balance of free and slave states in the Senate.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Sectional Balance and the Underground Railroad</b></p>
<p>
  <u>Harriet Tubman:</u> an illiterate runaway slave who helped rescue hundreds
  of slaves through the <strong>Underground Railroad</strong>, a network of
  anti-slavery homes that passed slaves from the slave states to Canada.
</p>
<p>
  By <strong>1850</strong>, southerners started to demand stricter
  <strong>fugitive-slave laws</strong>.&nbsp; (The old fugitive-slave law passed
  by Congress in 1793 was very weak.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Twilight of the Senatorial Giants</b></p>
<p>
  The <strong>congressional debate of</strong> <strong>1850 </strong>was called
  to address the admission of California to the Union and threats of secession
  by southerners.&nbsp; Known as the "<strong>immortal trio</strong>," Henry
  Clay, John Calhoun, and Daniel Webster spoke at the debate.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Henry Clay</u>, the "<strong>Great Compromiser</strong>," proposed a series
  of compromises.&nbsp; He suggested that the North enact a stricter
  fugitive-slave law.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <u>John Calhoun</u>, the "<strong>Great Nullifier</strong>," proposed to
  return runaway slaves, give the South its rights as a minority, and restore
  the political balance.&nbsp; His ultimate plan was for America to have two
  presidents, one from the South and one from the North, each yielding one veto.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Daniel Webster</u> called for people to make
  <strong>concessions</strong> and support Clay's proposals, for the sake of
  maintaining the Union (<strong>Seventh of March Speech</strong>). He was
  against slavery, but he viewed the collapse of the Union as worse.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Deadlock and Danger on Capital Hill</b></p>
<p>
  <u>William H. Seward:</u> senator of New York; opposed slavery and because of
  this, he opposed Clay's proposals; argued that God's moral law was higher than
  the Constitution.
</p>
<p>
  President Zachary Taylor opposed slavery and seemed ready to veto any
  compromise between the North and South that went through Congress.

<p><b>Breaking the Congressional Logjam</b></p>
<p>
  In <strong>1850</strong>, President Taylor died suddenly and Vice President
  <u>Millard Fillmore</u> took the presidency.&nbsp; President Fillmore signed a
  series of compromises contained within the
  <strong>Compromise of 1850</strong>. In regards to slavery, California was
  admitted as a free state, but the territories of New Mexico and Utah were open
  to popular sovereignty. Additionally, slave trade was outlawed in the District
  of Columbia, but a stricter fugitive-slave law was enacted.
</p>
<p>
  During this time period, a <strong>second</strong>
  <strong>Era of Good Feelings</strong> came about.&nbsp; Talk of secession
  subsided and the Northerners and Southerners were determined that the
  compromises would end the issue of slavery.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Balancing the Compromise Scales</b></p>
<p>
  Because the Compromise of 1850 allowed California and the New Mexico/Utah
  territories to be free, the<strong> Senate became unbalanced</strong> in favor
  of the North.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>Fugitive-Slave Law of 1850</strong>, the Bloodhound Bill, said
  that fleeing slaves could not testify on their own behalf and they were denied
  a jury trial.&nbsp; Northerners who aided slaves trying to escape were subject
  to fines and jail time. &nbsp;This law was the South's only real gain from the
  compromise.
</p>
<p>
  Some historians argue that the Compromise of 1850 strengthened the
  Northerner's desire to keep the Union together.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Defeat and Doom for the Whigs</b></p>
<p>
  In the Democratic Convention of 1852 in Baltimore, the
  <strong> Democrats</strong> chose <u>Franklin Pierce</u> as their candidate
  for president.&nbsp; He supported the Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive
  Slave Law.
</p>
<p>
  Meeting in Baltimore, the <strong>Whigs</strong> chose
  <u>Winfield Scott</u> as their candidate for president.&nbsp; He also
  supported the Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Law.
</p>
<p>
  The votes for the Whig party were split between
  <strong>Northern Whigs</strong>, who hated the party's platform (support of
  Fugitive Slave Law) but accepted the candidate, and
  <strong> Southern Whigs</strong>, who supported the platform but not the
  candidate (they doubted his support of the Fugitive Slave Law).
</p>
<p>
  <u>Franklin Pierce</u> won the <strong>election of 1852</strong>.&nbsp; The
  election of 1852 marked the end of the Whig party.&nbsp; It died on the issue
  of the Fugitive Slave Law.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Expansionist Stirrings South of the Border</strong></p>
<p>The victory of the Mexican War stimulated the spirit of Manifest Destiny.</p>
<p>
  Americans started to take an interest in Central America. A canal route
  between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that ran through Central America would
  be vitally important to America.
</p>
<p>
  The Americans and New Granada agreed to a treaty in 1848 that guaranteed
  America's right to use the isthmus in return for America's pledge to allow any
  other country to also use the isthmus. The
  <strong>Clayton-Bulwer Treaty</strong> of 1850 said that neither America nor
  Britain would fortify or secure exclusive control over any isthmian waterway.
</p>
<p>
  Because the Compromise of 1850 prohibited slavery in the land gained in the
  Mexican War, southern Americans sought new territory to expand slavery. These
  people were known as "slavocrats." One slavocrat, <u>William Walker</u>,
  installed himself as the President of <strong>Nicaragua</strong> in July
  <strong>1856</strong>.&nbsp; He legalized slavery, but was overthrown by
  surrounding Central American countries and killed in <strong>1860</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Southerners wanted to annex <strong>Cuba</strong> and turn it into a set of
  slave states. This would restore the balance in the Senate.
</p>
<p>
  President Polk offered $100 million to buy Cuba from <strong> Spain</strong>,
  but Spain refused.&nbsp; In <strong>1850-1851</strong>, two expeditions of
  Southern men descended upon Cuba, with the hopes of taking it over. Both
  expeditions were defeated.
</p>
<p>
  Spanish officials in Cuba seized an American ship, the
  <strong> <em>Black Warrior</em></strong
  >, in <strong>1854</strong>.&nbsp; This accelerated President Pierce's
  interest in taking Cuba from Spain, either by force or by purchasing it.
</p>
<p>
  The secretary of state instructed the American ministers in Spain, England,
  and France to prepare confidential recommendations for the acquisition of
  Cuba.&nbsp; This document was known as the
  <strong>Ostend Manifesto</strong>.&nbsp; It stated that if Spain didn't allow
  America to buy Cuba for $120 million, then America would attack Cuba on
  grounds that Spain's continued ownership of Cuba endangered American
  interests.&nbsp; The document eventually leaked out and the Northerners foiled
  the President's slave-driven plan.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Allure of Asia</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>Opium War</strong>: fought between Britain and China over the rights
  of British traders to trade opium in China; Britain won in 1842, gaining
  control of Hong Kong.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Treaty of Wanghia</strong>: the first diplomatic agreement between
  America and China; signed in 1844; expanded trade between the two countries.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Treaty of Kanagawa</strong>: opened up a small amount of trade between
  America and Japan; signed in 1854; it was Japan's first real interaction with
  the Western world in over 200 years.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Pacific Railroad Promoters and the Gadsden Purchase</b></p>
<p>
  After California and Oregon were acquired, the
  <strong> transcontinental railroad</strong> was proposed.&nbsp; The open
  question was: Where to put the railroad's terminus? In the North or the South?
</p>
<p>
  Secretary of War <u>Jefferson Davis</u> had <u>James Gadsden</u> buy an area
  of Mexico from Santa Anna through which the railroad would pass.&nbsp; Gadsden
  negotiated a treaty in 1853 and the <strong>Gadsden Purchase area</strong> was
  ceded to the United States for $10 million.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Southerners argued that the railroad should run through Texas and the New
  Mexico territory because Texas was already a state and the New Mexico
  territory was a formally organized territory (it had federal troops to provide
  protection from Indians). The proposed Northern railroad route ran through the
  Nebraska territory, which was not protected by troops. The Northerners
  proposed plans for organizing this territory.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Douglas's Kansas-Nebraska Scheme</b></p>
<p>
  <u>Stephen A. Douglas:</u> senator who tried to break the North-South deadlock
  over westward expansion; proposed the
  <strong>Territory of Nebraska</strong> to be sliced into two
  territories,<strong> Kansas</strong> and <strong>Nebraska</strong>.&nbsp;
  Their status on slavery would be decided by popular sovereignty.&nbsp; Kansas
  would be presumed to be a slave state, while Nebraska would be a free state.
</p>
<p>
  This <strong>Kansas-Nebraska Act</strong> conflicted with the Missouri
  Compromise of 1820, which forbade slavery in the proposed Nebraska Territory.
  Douglas was forced to propose the repealing of the Missouri Compromise.
  President Pierce fully supported the Kansas-Nebraska Bill.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Congress Legislates a Civil War</b></p>
<p>
  The Kansas-Nebraska Act <strong>wrecked two compromises</strong>: the
  Compromise of 1820 was repealed by the act; the Compromise of 1850 was
  henceforth rejected by Northerners.
</p>
<p>
  The blunder of the Kansas-Nebraska Act hurt the <strong>Democratic</strong>
  <strong>Party</strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>Republican Party</strong> was formed in the Mid-West and it was
  morally against slavery.&nbsp; The party included Whigs, Democrats,
  Free-Soilers, Know-Nothings, and other foes of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.&nbsp;
  The Southerners hated the Republican Party.

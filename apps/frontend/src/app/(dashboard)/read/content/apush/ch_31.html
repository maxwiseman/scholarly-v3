<h3>Chapter 31</h3>
<h4>American Life in the "Roaring Twenties"</h4>
<h4>1919-1929</h4>
<hr />
<p><b>Seeing Red</b></p>
<p>
  Fear of <b>Russia</b> swept across the country in the years following the
  communist Bolshevik revolution of 1917.
</p>
<p>
  The "<b>red scare</b>" of 1919-1920 resulted in a nationwide crusade against
  people whose Americanism was suspect.&nbsp; Attorney General
  <u>A. Mitchell Palmer</u> rounded up people who were in question.
</p>
<p>
  In 1919-1920, some states passed <b>criminal syndicalism laws</b> that made it
  illegal to advocate the use of violence to obtain social change. Traditional
  American ideals of free speech were restricted.
</p>
<p>
  Striking employees were viewed as Un-American. Some business supported the
  <strong>American plan</strong>, in which employees were not required to join
  unions.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Antiredism</b> and <b>antiforeignism</b> were reflected in the criminal
  case of <u>Nicola Sacco</u> and <u>Bartolomeo Vanzetti</u>.&nbsp; The two men
  were convicted in <b>1921</b> of the murder of a Massachusetts paymaster and
  his guard.&nbsp; Although given a trial, the jury and judge were prejudiced
  against the men because they were Italians, atheists, anarchists, and draft
  dodgers.&nbsp; Despite criticism from liberals and radicals all over the
  world, the men were electrocuted in <b>1927</b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Hooded Hoodlums of the KKK</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>Ku Klux Klan </b>(<b>Knights of the Invisible Empire</b>) grew in the
  early 1920s out of the growing intolerance and prejudice of the American
  public. It was most popular in the Midwest and the South.&nbsp; The Klan was
  antiforeign, anti-Catholic, anti-black, anti-Jewish, antipacifist,
  anti-Communist, anti-internationalist, antievolutionist, antibootlegger,
  antigambling, antiadultery, and anti-birth control.&nbsp; It was
  pro-Anglo-Saxon, pro-"native" American, and pro-Protestant.
</p>
<p>
  It fell apart in the late 1920s after it was discovered that Klan official
  were embezzling money.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Stemming the Foreign Blood</b></p>
<p>
  Isolationist Americans of the 1920s felt they had no use for
  immigrants.&nbsp;The <b>Emergency Quota Act of 1921</b> placed a
  <strong>quota</strong> on the number of European immigrants who could come to
  America each year; it was set at 3% of the people of their nationality who had
  been living in the United States in 1910.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Immigration Act of 1924</b> replaced the Quota Act of 1921, cutting
  quotas for foreigners from 3% to 2%.&nbsp; Japanese were banned from coming to
  America.&nbsp; Canadians and Latin Americans were exempt from the act, because
  their close proximity made it easy to attract them when they were needed and
  it was easy to send them home when they were not needed.
</p>
<p>The quota system significantly reduced immigration.</p>
<p>
  The Immigration Act of 1924 ended the era of unrestricted immigration to the
  United States.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Prohibition "Experiment"</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>18<sup>th</sup> Amendment</b>, passed in <b>1919</b>, banned alcohol.
  It was enforced by the <strong>Volstead Act</strong>.&nbsp;
  <b>Prohibition</b> was popular in the South, where white southerners wanted to
  keep stimulants out of the hands of blacks, and in the West, where alcohol was
  associated with crime and corruption.
</p>
<p>
  Prohibitionists were na√Øve in believing that the law could be enforced; the
  Federal government had a weak track record of enforcing laws that controlled
  personal lives. Prohibition might have started off better if there had been a
  larger number of enforcement officials.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  "<b>Speakeasies</b>" replaced saloons.&nbsp; Prohibition caused bank savings
  to increase and absenteeism in industry to decrease.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Golden Age of Gangsterism</b></p>
<p>
  Violent wars broke out in the big cities between rival gangs, who sought
  control of the illegal booze market.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>Chicago</b>,&nbsp;"Scarface" <u>Al Capone</u>, a murderous booze
  distributor, began 6 years of gang warfare that generated millions of
  dollars.&nbsp; Capone was eventually tried and convicted of income-tax evasion
  and sent to prison for 11 years.
</p>
<p>
  Gangsters began to move into other profitable and illicit activities:&nbsp;
  prostitution, gambling, narcotics, and kidnapping for ransom.
</p>
<p>
  After the son of <u>Charles A. Lindbergh</u> was kidnapped for ransom and then
  murdered, Congress passed the <b>Lindbergh Law</b> in <b>1932</b>, making
  interstate abduction in certain circumstances a death-penalty offense.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Monkey Business in Tennessee</b></p>
<p>
  In the 1920s, states started to put a larger focus on<b> education</b>.
  Professor <u>John Dewey</u> set forth the principles of "learning by doing"
  that formed the foundation of so-called progressive education.&nbsp; He
  believed that "education for life" should be a primary goal of the teacher.
</p>
<p>Science and healthcare also improved during the 1920s.</p>
<p>
  <b>Fundamentalists</b>, old-time religionists, claimed that the teaching of
  <b>Darwinism</b> <b>evolution</b> was destroying faith in God and the Bible,
  while contributing to the moral breakdown of youth.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1925</b>, <u>John T. Scopes</u> was indicted in Tennessee for teaching
  evolution.&nbsp; At the "<b>Monkey Trial</b>," Scopes was defended by
  <u>Clarence Darrow</u>, while former presidential candidate
  <u> William Jennings Bryan</u> prosecuted him.&nbsp; Scopes was found guilty
  and fined $100.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Mass-Consumption Economy</b></p>
<p>
  World War I and Treasury Secretary <u>Andrew Mellon's</u> tax policies brought
  prosperity to the mid-1920s.
</p>
<p><u>Bruce Barton</u> founded <b>advertising</b>.</p>
<p><b>Sports</b> became a big business in the consumer economy of the 1920s.</p>
<p>
  Buying in <b>credit</b> was another new feature of the postwar economy.&nbsp;
  Prosperity thus led to increased personal debt, and the economy became
  increasingly vulnerable to disruptions of the credit structure.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Putting America on Rubber Tires</b></p>
<p>
  The automobile industry started an industrial revolution in the 1920s.&nbsp;
  It created a new industrial system based on assembly-line methods and
  mass-production techniques.&nbsp; <strong>Detroit</strong> became the motorcar
  capital of the world.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Henry Ford</u>, father of the moving assembly line
  (<strong>Fordism</strong>), created the <b>Model T</b>.&nbsp; By 1930, more
  than 20 million Model Ts were being driven in the country.

<p><b>The Advent of the Gasoline Age</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>automobile</b> <b>industry</b> exploded, creating millions of jobs and
  related support industries.&nbsp; America's standard of living rose. The
  petroleum business grew, while the railroad industry was hard hit by the
  competition of automobiles.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The automobile freed up women from their dependence on men, and it allowed
  suburbs to spread out. It was responsible for millions of deaths, but it
  brought more convenience, pleasure, and excitement into peoples' lives.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Humans Develop Wings</b></p>
<p>
  Gasoline engines led to the invention of the airplane. On
  <b>December 17, 1903</b>, <u>Orville and Wilbur Wright</u> made their first
  <b>flight</b>, lasting 12 seconds and 120 feet.
</p>
<p>
  After the success of airplanes in WWI, private companies began to operate
  passenger airlines with airmail contracts.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Charles A. Lindberg</u> became the first man to fly solo across the
  Atlantic Ocean in <b>1927</b>.&nbsp; His flight energized the new aviation
  industry.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Radio Revolution</b></p>
<p>
  <u>Guglielmo Marconi</u> invented wireless telegraphy (the <b>telegraph</b>)
  in the 1890s.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In the 1920s, the first voice-carrying radio broadcasts were transmitted.
  Automobiles drew Americans away from the home, but the radio brought them
  back.&nbsp; The radio made significant educational and cultural contributions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Hollywood's Filmland Fantasies</b></p>
<p>
  <b>Motion picture</b>, which had been partially developed by
  <u>Thomas A. Edison</u>, began in the 1890s.&nbsp; The true birth of motion
  picture came in 1903 with the release of the first story sequence:&nbsp;
  <i> The Great Train Robbery</i>.&nbsp; Hollywood became the movie capital of
  the world.
</p>
<p>
  Motion picture was used extensively in WWI as anti-German propaganda.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The spread of motion picture led to increased assimilation of immigrants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Dynamic Decade</b></p>
<p>
  By the 1920s, most Americans had moved from rural areas to urban (city)
  areas.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <u>Margaret Sanger</u> led a birth-control movement.&nbsp;
  <u>Alice Paul</u> formed the <b> National Women's Party</b> in <b>1923</b> to
  campaign for an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Fundamentalists</b> lost ground to the <b>Modernists</b> who believed
  that God was a "good guy" and the universe was a friendly place.
</p>
<p>
  Sex appeal in America grew in the 1920s. <b>Flappers</b>: young women who
  expressed their disdain for traditional women behavior by wearing short
  skirts, drinking, driving cars, and smoking.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Dr. Sigmund Freud</u> argued that sexual repression was responsible for a
  variety of emotional problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>Jazz</b> thrived in the 1920s.</p>
<p>
  Racial pride grew in the northern black communities.&nbsp;
  <u>Marcus Garvey</u> founded the
  <b>United Negro Improvement Association</b> (UNIA) to promote the resettlement
  of blacks in Africa.&nbsp; In the United States, the UNIA also sponsored
  stores and other businesses to keep blacks' dollars in black pockets.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Cultural Liberation</b></p>
<p>
  In the decade after WWI, a new generation of writers emerged.&nbsp; They gave
  American literature new life, imaginativeness, and artistic quality.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Modernism</strong>: philosophical movement during the 1920s; a key
  component of this movement was the questioning of social conventions.
</p>
<p>
  <u>H.L. Mencken</u> attacked marriage, patriotism, democracy, and prohibition
  in his monthly <i>American Mercury</i>.
</p>
<p>
  <u>F. Scott Fitzgerald</u> wrote <i>This Side of Paradise</i> in
  <b>1920</b> and <b><i>The Great Gatsby</i></b> in <b>1925</b>.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Earnest Hemingway</u> was among the writers most affected by the war.&nbsp;
  He responded to propaganda and the overblown appeal to patriotism.&nbsp; He
  wrote of disillusioned, spiritually numb American expatriates in Europe in
  <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> (<b>1926</b>).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <u>Sinclair Lewis</u> wrote <i>Main Street</i> (<b>1920</b>) and
  <i>Babbitt</i> (<b>1922</b>).
</p>
<p><u>Sherwood Anderson</u> wrote <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i> (<b>1919</b>).</p>
<p>
  <strong>Harlem Renaissance</strong>: a black cultural movement that grew out
  of Harlem
</p>
<p>
  Architecture also became popular as materialism and functionalism became
  popular.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Wall Street's Big Bull Market</b></p>
<p>
  In the 1920s, the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> became increasingly popular to
  the average citizen.
</p>
<p>The Federal government did little to manage the national debt after WWI.</p>
<p>
  In <b>1921</b>, the Republican Congress created the
  <b> Bureau of the Budget</b> to help the president submit an
  <strong>annual budget</strong> to Congress.&nbsp; It was designed to prevent
  haphazardly extravagant appropriations.
</p>
<p>
  Treasury Secretary <u>Andrew Mellon's</u> belief was that taxes forced the
  rich to invest in tax-exempt securities rather than in factories; this hurt
  business. Mellon helped create a series of tax reductions from 1921-1926 to
  help rich people. Congress also eliminated the gift tax, reduced excise taxes,
  the surtax, the income tax, and estate taxes.&nbsp; Mellon's policies shifted
  the tax burden from the wealthy to the middle-income groups.&nbsp; Mellon
  reduced the national debt by $10 billion.

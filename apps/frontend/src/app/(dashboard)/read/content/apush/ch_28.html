<p>Chapter 28</p>
<p>Progressivism and the Republican Roosevelt</p>
<p>1901-1912</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>progressive</strong> <strong>movement</strong> started &nbsp;at the beginning of the 20th Century. It sought to use the government to improve human welfare, and they fought monopolies, corruption, inefficiency, and social injustice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Progressive Roots</b></p>
<p><u>Henry Demarest Lloyd</u> was critical of the Standard Oil Company in 1894 with his book, <strong><u>Wealth Against 
  Commonwealth</u></strong>.&nbsp; <u>Jacob A. Riis</u> shocked middle-class Americans in 
  1890 with <strong><u>How the Other Half Lives,</u></strong> which described the slums of New York.</p>
<p>Socialists and feminists were at the front of social 
justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Raking Muck with the Muckrakers</b></p>
<p><strong>Muckrakers</strong> were reform-minded journalists who wrote articles in magazines that exposed corruption and scandal. President Roosevelt coined this term. These reporters went after trusts and politicians.</p>
<p>In <strong>1902</strong>, New York reporter, <u>Lincoln Steffens</u> wrote "<strong>The Shame of the 
  Cities</strong>" which unmasked the corrupt alliance between big business and 
  municipal government.</p>
<p><u>Ida M. Tarbell</u> published a devastating depiction of the Standard Oil Company. </p>
<p><u>David G. Phillips</u> published a series, "<strong>The 
  Treason of the Senate</strong>" in <em>Cosmopolitan</em> that charged that 75 of the 90 
  senators did not represent the people, but they rather represented railroads and 
  trusts.</p>
<p>Some of the most effective attacks of the muckrakers were 
directed at social evils.&nbsp; The suppression of America's blacks was shown in <u>
Ray Stannard's </u><b><i>Following the Color Line</i></b> (1908).&nbsp; <u>John 
Spargo</u> wrote of the abuses of child labor in <b><i>The Bitter Cry of the 
Children</i></b> (1906). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Political Progressivism</b></p>
<p>Progressive reformers were mainly middle-class men and 
women.</p>
<p>The progressives sought <strong>2 goals</strong>: &nbsp;1) To use state power 
  to control trusts;&nbsp; 2) To improve the common person's conditions of life and labor.</p>
<p>Progressives wanted to regain the power that had shifted from the hands of the people into those of the "interests."&nbsp; Progressives 
  supported the "<strong>initiative</strong>" so that 
  voters could directly propose legislation. They also supported the "<strong>referendum</strong>" and the "<strong>recall,</strong>" which allowed voters to directly vote on laws to remove corrupt elected officials, respectively. </p>
<p>The progressive 
  reformers convinced Congress to pass the <strong>17<sup>th</sup> Amendment</strong> in <strong>1913</strong>.&nbsp; It established the direct election of U.S. senators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Progressivism in the Cities and States</b></p>
<p>States used public utility commissions to regulate railroads and trusts. <u>Robert M. La 
  Follette</u> was a governor of Wisconsin who took control from the corrupt corporations and 
  returned it to the people.</p>
<p>Governor of California, <u>Hiram W. Johnson</u> helped to 
  break the grip of the Southern Pacific Railroad on California politics 
  in <strong>1910</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Progressive Women</b></p>
<p>Women formed clubs in which they discussed and proposed solutions for societal problems (<strong>club movement</strong>). Some of these included the <strong>Women's Trade Union League</strong> and the <strong>National Consumers League</strong>.</p>


<p><u>Florence Kelley</u> took control of the <b>National 
Consumers League</b> in <b>1899</b> and mobilized female consumers to pressure 
for laws safeguarding women and children in the workplace.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In <strong><em>Muller vs. Oregon</em> (1908)</strong>, the Supreme Court ruled that it was constitutional to enact laws that specifically protected women factory workers. </p>
<p><strong><em>Lochner vs. New York</em> (1905) </strong>invalidated a New York law that limited the work day to 10 hours for bakers. The law was eventually upheld in 1917.</p>
<p>Following a series of factory accidents, several states passed stronger laws regulating the working conditions in factories.</p>
<p>The <strong>Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) </strong>was a large anti-alcohol women's group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>TR's Square Deal for Labor</b></p>
<p>President Roosevelt believed in the progressive reform.&nbsp; He 
enacted a "<b>Square Deal</b>" program that consisted of 3 parts:&nbsp; control of 
the corporations, consumer protection, and conservation of natural resources.</p>
<p>In <strong>1902</strong>, coal miners in Pennsylvania went on strike 
  and demanded a 20% raise in pay and a workday decrease from 10 hours to 9 
  hours.&nbsp; When mine spokesman, <u>George F. Baer</u> refused to negotiate, 
  President Roosevelt stepped in and threatened to operate the mines with federal 
  troops.&nbsp; A deal was struck in which the miners received a 10% pay raise and 9 hour workday.</p>
<p>The increasing hostilities between 
  capital and labor forced Congress to create the <strong>Department of Commerce</strong> in <strong>1903</strong>. This department provided oversight of businesses engaged in interstate commerce.</p>

<p><b>TR Corrals the Corporations</b></p>
<p>Although the Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 
  1887, railroads were able to delay the commission's decisions by appealing to the federal 
  courts.</p>
<p>Railroad companies historically offered incentives, in the form of rebates, to convince companies to use their rail lines. In <strong>1903</strong>, Congress passed the <strong>Elkins Act</strong>, 
  which fined railroads that gave rebates and the shippers that accepted them.</p>
<p>Congress passed the <strong>Hepburn Act of 1906</strong>, which restricted free passes and expanded the Interstate Commerce Commission. (<strong>Free 
  passes</strong>:&nbsp; rewards offered to companies, in the form of free 
  shipments; given to companies to encourage future business.)</p>
<p>In <b>1902</b>, President Roosevelt challenged the <b>
Northern Securities Company</b>, a railroad trust company that sought to achieve 
a monopoly of the railroads in the Northwest.&nbsp; The Supreme Court upheld the 
President and the trust was forced to be dissolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Caring for the Consumer</b></p>
<p>After botulism was found in American meats, foreign 
  governments threatened to ban all American meat imports. &nbsp;President Roosevelt passed the <strong>Meat Inspection Act of 1906</strong>.&nbsp; The act 
  stated that the preparation of meat shipped over state lines was subject to 
  federal inspection.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The <b>Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906</b> was designed to 
prevent the adulteration and mislabelling of foods and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Earth Control</b></p>
<p>The first step towards conservation came with the <strong>Desert 
  Land Act of 1887</strong>, in which the federal government sold dry land cheaply 
  on the condition that the purchaser would irrigate the soil within 3 years.&nbsp; A 
  more successful step was the <strong>Forest Reserve Act of 1891</strong>.&nbsp; It authorized 
  the president to set aside public forests as national parks and other reserves.&nbsp; 
  The <strong>Carey Act of 1894 </strong>distributed federal land to the states on the 
  condition that it be irrigated and settled.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt, a naturalist and rancher, convinced 
  Congress to pass the <strong>Newlands Act of 1902</strong>, which authorized the federal 
  government use money from the sale of public lands in western states to develop irrigation projects.</p>
<p>In <strong>1900,</strong> Roosevelt, attempting to preserve the 
  nation's shrinking forests, set aside 125 million acres of land in federal 
  reserves.</p>
<p>Under President Roosevelt, professional foresters and 
  engineers developed a policy of "<strong>multiple-use resource management</strong>." &nbsp;This policy sought to <strong>sustainably</strong> use federal lands for recreation, logging, watershed protection, and 
  cattle grazing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The "Roosevelt Panic" of 1907</b></p>
<p><u>Theodore Roosevelt</u> was re-elected as president in <strong> 1904</strong>.&nbsp; President Roosevelt made it known that he would not run for a 3<sup>rd</sup> term.</p>
<p>The <strong>panic of </strong><strong>1907</strong> was a short economic downturn that resulted in financial reforms. Congress passed the <strong>Aldrich-Vreeland Act </strong>in 1908, which authorized national banks to issue emergency currency in the event of a currency shortage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Rough Rider Thunders Out</b></p>
<p>For the <b>election of 1908</b>, the Republican Party chose
<u>William Howard Taft</u>, secretary of war to Theodore Roosevelt.&nbsp; The 
Democratic Party chose <u>William Jennings Bryan</u>.</p>
<p><u>William Howard Taft</u> won the election of 1908.</p>
<p>During Roosevelt's presidency, Roosevelt greatly 
  enlarged the power of the presidential office, and he helped shape 
  the progressive movement. He also opened the eyes of Americans to the fact that they shared 
  the world with other nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Taft:&nbsp; A Round Peg in a Square Hole</b></p>
<p><u>President Taft</u> was not an adept political leader, such as Roosevelt.&nbsp; He generally 
  adopted an attitude of passivity towards Congress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Dollar Goes Abroad as a Diplomat</b></p>
<p>Taft encouraged Wall Street bankers to invest in foreign 
  areas of strategic interest to the United States (<strong>dollar diplomacy</strong>).&nbsp; American bankers thus 
  strengthened American defenses and foreign policies, while bringing prosperity 
  to America.</p>
<p>Japan and Russia controlled the railroads in China's <strong>Manchuria.</strong> President Taft feared that this monopoly would eventually hurt American merchants. In <strong>1909</strong>, Secretary of State <u>Philander C. Knox</u> proposed 
  that Americans buy the Manchurian railroads and 
  then turn them over to China.&nbsp; Both Japan and Russia rejected the selling 
  of their railroads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Taft the Trustbuster</b></p>
<p>Taft brought 90 lawsuits against trusts during his 4 
  years in office, as opposed to Roosevelt's 44 suits in 7 years.</p>
<p>In <b>1911</b>, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution 
of the <b>Standard Oil Company</b>, stating that it violated the Sherman 
Anti-Trust Act of 1890.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also in <strong>1911</strong>, the Supreme Court laid out its "<strong>rule of 
  reason</strong>" doctrine. This stated that a trust was illegal only if it unreasonably 
  restrained trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Taft Splits the Republican Party</b></p>
<p>President Taft signed the <strong>Payne-Aldrich Bill</strong> in <strong> 1909</strong>, which placed a high tariff on many imports. This angered many Republicans because before he was elected, Taft said that he would lower the tariff.</p>
<p>Taft was a strong conservationist, but his conservationist record was tarnished in <strong>1910</strong> when he fired the
  chief of the Agriculture Department's Division of Forestry, <u>Gifford Pinchot</u>, for insubordination. (<strong>Ballinger-Pinchot quarrel</strong>) Pinchot was liked by conservationists.</p>
<p>By the spring of <strong>1910</strong>, the reformist wing of the 
  Republican Party was furious with Taft, causing the <strong>Republican Party</strong> to<strong> split</strong>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Taft-Roosevelt Rupture</b></p>
<p>In <strong>1911</strong>, the <strong>National Progressive Republican 
  League</strong> was formed with <u>La Follette</u> as its leading candidate for the 
  Republican presidential nomination. La Follette was chosen because it was assumed that Roosevelt would not re-run for election.</p>
<p>In February of <strong>1912</strong>, <u>Theodore Roosevelt</u> decided to challenge Taft for the Republican presidential nomination. (La Follette was replaced by Roosevelt.) Roosevelt and Taft became opponents because Roosevelt felt that Taft had discarded many of Roosevelt's policies.</p>
<p>Taft won the Republican nomination after Roosevelt Republicans refused to vote at the 1912 Republican convention, claiming fraud. Roosevelt continued on as a 3rd-party candidate.</p>

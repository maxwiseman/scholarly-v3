<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<h4>Drifting Toward Disunion</h4>
<h4>1854-1861</h4>
<hr />
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Kansas Territory erupted in violence in 1855 between the proslavery and
  antislavery factions.&nbsp; In 1857, the Supreme Court's
  <em>Dred Scott</em> decision permitted slavery in all Western territories,
  invalidating the Missouri Compromise of 1820.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Stowe and Helper: &nbsp;Literary Incendiaries</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>Harriet Beecher Stowe</u>, who was white, published
  <strong> <u>Uncle Tom's Cabin</u></strong> in <strong>1852</strong> as an
  attempt to show the North the horrors of slavery.&nbsp; The novel was
  published abroad, including France and Britain.&nbsp; It helped to start the
  Civil War and for the North to win it.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>Hinton R. Helper</u>, a non-aristocrat from North Carolina, wrote
  <strong><u>The Impending Crisis of the South</u></strong> in
  <strong>1857</strong>.&nbsp; He hated both blacks and slavery, and he
  attempted to use statistics to prove that the non-slaveholding whites were the
  ones who suffered the most from slavery.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The North-South Contest for Kansas</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Most of the people who came to Kansas were just westward-moving
  pioneers.&nbsp; The <strong>New England Emigrant Aid Company</strong>, a group
  of abolitionists, paid some people to move to Kansas to make it a free
  state.&nbsp;(The Kansas and Nebraska territories had popular sovereignty in
  choosing slavery, according to the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Nebraska was so far
  north that its future as a free state was never in question.)
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1855</strong> when Kansas was having its legislature elections,
  many pro-slavery people came from Missouri to vote. They sought to elect
  pro-slavery officials.&nbsp; The slavery supporters won the elections and set
  up their own government at <strong>Shawnee Mission</strong>. &nbsp;The
  abolitionists then set up their own government in <strong>Topeka</strong>,
  giving the Kansas territory two governments.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1856</strong>, the civil war in Kansas started when a group of
  pro-slavery riders burned down part of the abolitionist's town of Lawrence.

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>John Brown:</u> fanatical abolitionist who, in May of 1856<strong
    >, </strong
  >hacked to death 5 presumed pro-slavery men at
  <strong>Pottawatomie Creek</strong> in response to the pro-slavery events in
  Lawrence.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Civil war flared up in Kansas in <strong>1856</strong>, and continued until it
  merged with the nation's Civil War of 1861-1865.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1857</strong>, Kansas had enough people to apply for
  statehood.&nbsp; Its citizens were going to vote again on whether or not to
  have slavery in the <strong>state</strong> of Kansas. &nbsp;To keep the
  abolitionists from creating a free state, the pro-slavery politicians created
  the <strong>Lecompton Constitution</strong>.&nbsp; The document stated that
  the people were not allowed to vote for or against the constitution as a
  whole, rather, they could vote on whether the constitution would be "<strong
    >with slavery</strong
  >" or "<strong>without slavery</strong>."&nbsp; If slavery was voted against,
  then one of the provisions in the constitution would protect those who already
  owned slaves in Kansas.&nbsp; Many abolitionists boycotted voting, so the
  constitution was approved to include slavery.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>James Buchanan</u>, a Democrat, succeeded Pierce as the President of the
  United States in the election of 1856.&nbsp; He had a strong southern
  influence and approved of the Lecompton Constitution.&nbsp;
  <u>Senator Stephen Douglas</u> was strongly opposed to the document and he
  campaigned against it.&nbsp; Eventually, a <strong> compromise</strong> was
  reached that enabled the people of Kansas to vote on the Lecompton
  Constitution, itself.&nbsp; It was revoked by the abolitionists voters, but
  Kansas ended up remaining a territory until <strong>1861</strong>, when the
  southern states seceded from the Union.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>President Buchanan</u> <strong>divided</strong> the powerful
  <strong> Democratic</strong> <strong>Party</strong> by enraging some Democrats
  of the North.&nbsp; He divided the only remaining
  <strong>national</strong> party and with it, the Union.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>"Bully" Brooks and His Bludgeon</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1856</b>, abolitionist <u>Senator Charles Sumner</u> of Massachusetts
  gave a provoking speech condemning pro-slavery men. During this speech, Sumner
  also personally insulted <u>Senator Andrew Butler</u> of South Carolina. Two
  days later on <b>May 22, 1856</b>, Butler's nephew, <u>Preston Brooks</u>,
  <b>beat</b> Sumner with a cane to unconsciousness.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The speech made by Sumner was applauded in the North, angering the South.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The clash between Sumner and Butler showed how violent and impassioned the
  Northerners and Southerners were for their cause.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>"Old Buck" Versus "The Pathfinder"</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Meeting in Cincinnati, the <strong>Democrats</strong> chose
  <u>James Buchanan</u> as their presidential candidate to run in the
  <strong>election of 1856</strong> because he wasn't involved with the divisive
  Kansas-Nebraska Act.&nbsp; The Democratic platform campaigned for popular
  sovereignty.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Meeting in Philadelphia, the <b>Republicans</b> chose
  <u> Captain John C. Fremont</u> because he was also not influenced by the
  Kansas-Nebraska Act.&nbsp; The Republican platform campaigned against the
  extension of slavery.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>American Party</strong>, also called the
  <strong>Know-Nothing Party</strong>, was formed by Protestants who were
  alarmed by the increasing number of immigrants coming from Ireland and
  Germany.&nbsp; They chose former president <u>Millard Fillmore</u> as their
  candidate for the election of 1856.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Electoral Fruits of 1856</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>James Buchanan</u> won the <b>election of 1856</b>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  It was a good thing that the Republican Party did not win the election because
  some southerners said that if a Republican had won, then they would secede.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  This election was a small victory for the Republican Party because the party
  was just 2 years old, yet it put up a fight for the Democrats.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Dred Scott Bombshell</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>Dread Scott</u>, a slave who had lived with his master for 5 years in
  Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory, sued for his freedom on the basis of his
  long residence on free soil.&nbsp; In
  <strong><em>Dred Scott vs. Stanford</em></strong
  >, the Supreme Court first ruled that because Scott was a black slave and not
  a citizen, he could not sue in Federal courts. The Court also ruled that
  because a slave was private property, he could be taken into any territory and
  legally held there in slavery.&nbsp; The
  <strong>Fifth Amendment</strong> forbade Congress from depriving people of
  their property without the due process of law.&nbsp; The Court went further
  and stated that the <strong>Missouri Compromise of 1820 was</strong>
  <strong>unconstitutional</strong> and that Congress had no power to ban
  slavery from the territories, no matter what the territorial legislatures
  themselves wanted.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  This victory delighted Southerners, while it infuriated Northerners and
  supporters of popular sovereignty.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Financial Crash of 1857</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>panic of 1857</strong> was caused by over-speculation in the West
  and currency inflation due to the inrush of Californian gold.&nbsp; The North
  was the hardest hit, while the South continued to flourish with its cotton.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Northerners came up with the idea of the government giving
  <strong>160-acre plots of farming</strong> <strong>land</strong> to pioneers
  for <strong>free</strong>.&nbsp; Two groups opposed the idea:&nbsp; Eastern
  industrialists feared that the free land would drain its supply of workers,
  and the South feared that the West would fill up with free-soilers who would
  form anti-slavery states, unbalancing the Senate even more.&nbsp; Congress
  passed a <strong>homestead act</strong> in <strong>1860</strong>, making
  public lands available at $0.25/acre, but it was vetoed by President Buchanan.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>Tariff of 1857</strong> lowered import taxes to about 20%.&nbsp;
  The North blamed it for causing the panic, because they felt they needed
  higher duties for more protection.&nbsp; This gave the Republicans two
  economic issues for the election of 1860:&nbsp; protection for the unprotected
  and farms for the farmless.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>An Illinois Rail-Splitter Emerges</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In Illinois's senatorial election of 1858, the Republicans chose
  <u>Abraham Lincoln</u> to run against Democrat <u>Stephen Douglas</u>.&nbsp;
  Lincoln served in the Illinois legislature as a Whig politician and he served
  one term in Congress.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Great Debate:&nbsp; Lincoln versus Douglas</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Lincoln challenged Douglas to a series of seven <strong>debates</strong> that
  were arranged from August to October
  <strong>1858 (Lincoln-Douglas debates)</strong>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The most famous debate happened in Freeport, Illinois.&nbsp; Lincoln asked
  Douglas, "What if the people of a territory should vote down slavery?"&nbsp;
  The Supreme Court in the Dred Scott decision had said that the people could
  not do this.&nbsp; Douglas's reply to him became known as the "<strong
    >Freeport</strong
  >
  <strong>Doctrine</strong>."&nbsp; Douglas argued that no matter how the
  Supreme Court ruled, slavery would stay down if the people voted it
  down.&nbsp; Laws to protect slavery would have to be voted on by the
  territorial legislatures.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Douglas won</b> the senatorial election, but Lincoln won the popular
  vote.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>John Brown:&nbsp; Murderer or Martyr?</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Abolitionist <u>John Brown</u> developed a plan to secretly&nbsp;invade the
  South, call upon the slaves to rise, give the slaves weapons, and establish a
  black free state.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>October 1859</strong>, he seized the<strong>
    federal arsenal</strong
  >
  at<strong> Harpers Ferry</strong>.&nbsp; Because many of his supporters failed
  to show up, he was caught and sent to death by hanging.&nbsp; When Brown died,
  he lived on as a martyr to the abolitionist cause.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Disruption of the Democrats</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  For the <strong>election of 1860</strong>, the <strong>Democrats</strong> met
  in <strong>Charleston</strong>, South Carolina to choose their
  candidate.&nbsp; The northern part of the party wanted to nominate
  <u>Stephen Douglas</u>, but the southern "<strong>fire-eaters</strong>" saw
  him as a traitor for his unpopular opposition to the
  <strong>Lecompton Constitution</strong> and his unpopular
  <strong>Freeport Doctrine</strong> reply.&nbsp; After the delegates from most
  of the cotton states walked out, the Democrats met again in
  <strong>Baltimore</strong> to elect a candidate.&nbsp; This time, Douglas was
  elected, despite the fact that the southerners again walked out.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <b>southern</b> Democrats met in <b>Baltimore</b> to choose their own
  Democratic presidential candidate.&nbsp; They chose vice-president
  <u>John C. Breckenridge</u>.&nbsp; The platform favored the extension of
  slavery into the territories and the annexation of slave-populated Cuba.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <b>Constitutional Union Party</b> was formed by former Whigs and
  Know-Nothings.&nbsp; They nominated <u>John Bell</u> as their presidential
  candidate.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A Rail-Splitter Splits the Union</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Republican Party met in Chicago and nominated <u> Abraham Lincoln</u> as
  their presidential candidate.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Republican platform
  <strong>appealed to nearly every part of the nation</strong>.&nbsp; For the
  free-soilers, the Republicans supported the non-extension of slavery. For the
  northern manufacturers, they supported a protective tariff. For the
  immigrants, the supported no abridgement of rights. For the Northwest, they
  supported a Pacific railroad. For the West, they supported internal
  improvements at federal expense. For the farmers, they supported free
  homesteads (plots of land) from the public domain.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Southerners said that if Abraham Lincoln was elected as President, the
  Union would split.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Electoral Upheaval of 1860</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>Abraham Lincoln</u> won the <b>election of 1860</b>, but he did not win
  with the <b>popular vote</b>.&nbsp; 60% of the nation voted for another
  candidate.&nbsp; 10 southern states didn't even allow Lincoln to appear on the
  ballot.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  South Carolina was happy at the outcome of the election because it now had a
  reason to secede.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Even though the Republicans won the presidential election, they did
  <b>not</b> <b>control</b> the House of Representatives, the Senate, or the
  Supreme Court.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Secessionist Exodus</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>December 1860</b>, South Carolina's legislature met in Charleston and
  voted unanimously to <b>secede</b>.&nbsp; 6 other states joined South
  Carolina:&nbsp; <b>Alabama</b>,<b> Mississippi</b>, <b>Florida</b>,
  <b>Georgia</b>, <b>Louisiana</b>, and<b> Texas</b>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The 7 seceders met at Montgomery, Alabama in <b>February</b> <b>1861</b> and
  created a government known as the <b>Confederate States of America</b>.&nbsp;
  The states chose <u>Jefferson Davis</u>, a recent member of the U.S. Senate
  from Mississippi, as President.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  During this time of secession, Buchanan was still the "lame duck" president,
  &nbsp;because Lincoln was not sworn in until 1861.&nbsp;
  <u>President Buchanan</u> did not hold the seceders in the Union by
  <strong>force</strong> because he was surrounded by pro-southern advisors and
  he could find no authority in the Constitution to stop them with force.
  Another reason that force was not used was because at the time, the Union's
  army was needed to control the Indians of the West. The Northerners were not
  eager to use force against the Southerners because that would have ended the
  possibility of peaceful negotiations.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Collapse of Compromise</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>Crittenden amendments</strong> to the Constitution were designed
  to appease the South.&nbsp; The amendments prohibited slavery in territories
  north of 36<sup>0</sup> 30', but it permitted slavery in the territories south
  of this line. Future states (north and south of this line) would get to vote
  on the issue of slavery. President Lincoln rejected the amendments.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Farewell to the Union</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The southern states seceded, fearing that the Republican Party would threaten
  their rights to own slaves.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Many southerners felt that their secession would be unopposed by the
  North.&nbsp; They assumed that the northern manufacturers and bankers,
  dependent upon southern cotton and markets, wouldn't dare cut off the South.

<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Philadelphia <strong>Quakers</strong> founded the first
  <strong>anti-slavery society</strong> in <strong>1775.</strong>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The 1st Continental Congress called for the complete
  <strong> abolition of the slave trade</strong> in <strong>1774</strong>.&nbsp;

  or provided the gradual emancipation of slaves.&nbsp; No states south of
  Pennsylvania abolished slavery.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Constitution Making in the States</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1776</strong>, the 2nd Continental Congress called the colonies to
  draft <strong>new constitutions</strong>.&nbsp; Massachusetts called a special
  convention to draft its constitution and then submitted the final draft to the
  people.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  As<b> written </b>documents, the state constitutions were intended to
  represent a <b>fundamental law</b>, superior to the short-lived impulses of
  ordinary legislation.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In the Revolutionary era, the capitals of New Hampshire, New York, Virginia,
  North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were all moved westward.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Economic Crosscurrents</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Economic democracy preceded political democracy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  After gaining its independence, the United States had limited trade with
  Britain, so it had to start making more products "in-house."
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The post-war economy was not very good, and many Americans were poorer after
  the war.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Creating a Confederation</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Shortly before declaring independence in 1776, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Continental
  Congress appointed a committee to draft a written constitution for the new
  nation.&nbsp; The finished product was the
  <strong>Articles of Confederation</strong>.&nbsp; It was
  <strong>adopted</strong> by Congress in <strong>1777</strong> and it convinced
  France that America had a genuine government.&nbsp; The Articles of
  Confederation wasn't <strong>ratified by all 13 colonies until 1781.</strong>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>The Articles of Confederation: America's First Constitution</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The 13 colonies were joined together for joint action in dealing with common
  problems such as foreign affairs.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>Congress had 2 major handicaps</strong>: 1) It had no power to
  regulate commerce, and this loophole left the states free to establish
  conflictingly laws regarding tariffs and navigation. &nbsp;2) Congress
  couldn't enforce its tax collection program.&nbsp; The states were NOT
  required to pay the government taxes, they were merely asked.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Articles of Confederation had many faults, but it was a stepping stone
  towards the Constitution.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Landmarks in Land Laws</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>Land Ordinance of 1785:</strong> stated that the acreage of the Old
  Northwest should be sold and the proceeds should be used to help pay off the
  national debt.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>Northwest Ordinance of 1787:</strong> a uniform national land policy;
  created the Northwest Territories and gave the land to the government, the
  land could then be purchased by individuals; when a territory had 60,000
  people, it might be admitted by Congress as a state, with all the privileges
  of the 13 other states.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The World's Ugly Duckling</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Britain declined to make any commercial treaty with the colonies or to repeal
  its Navigation Laws (required the use of British ships to trade with Britain).
  <u>Lord Sheffield</u> argued in his pamphlet that Britain could win back
  America's trade without repealing the navigation laws.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>British remained in the Americas </strong>where they maintained
  their fur trade with the Indians.&nbsp; The American states did not honor the
  treaty of peace in regard to debts and Loyalists.&nbsp; The British
  primarily&nbsp;stayed because they wanted to keep the Indians on their side in
  case the Americans decided to attack Canada.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Spain was openly unfriendly to the Americans.&nbsp; It closed off the
  Mississippi river to commerce in <b>1784</b>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Horrid Specter of Anarchy</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>Shay's Rebellion:</strong> occurred in western Massachusetts in
  <strong> 1786</strong>; impoverished back-country farmers, who were losing
  their farms through mortgage foreclosures and tax delinquencies, attempted to
  enforce their demands of cheap paper money, lighter taxes, and a suspension of
  property takeovers; led by <u>Captain Daniel Shays</u>.&nbsp; The uprising was
  crushed but it led to changes in laws.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A Convention of "Demigods"</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1786</strong>, Virginia called for a
  <strong>convention at Annapolis, Maryland </strong>to deal with the issue of
  <strong>interstate commerce</strong>. <u>Alexander Hamilton</u> saved the
  convention from collapsing (delegates from only 5 states showed up). &nbsp;He
  called Congress to meet in Philadelphia the next year to fix<strong>
    entire fabric of the Articles of Confederation</strong
  >. <br />
  Alexander Hamilton was an advocate of a powerful central government.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  On <strong>May 25, 1787</strong>, 55 representatives from every state except
  for Rhode Island were sent to Philadelphia to discuss how the government
  should operate. &nbsp;(<strong>Constitutional Convention</strong>)&nbsp;
  George Washington was elected as the leader.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Patriots in Philadelphia</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The delegates hoped to save the revolutionary idealism and make it into a
  strong political structure.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Hammering Out a Bundle of Compromises</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Some of the delegates decided they would<b> scrap</b> the old Articles of
  Confederation, contradicting instructions from Congress to revise it.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The "<strong>large-state plan</strong>" was proposed by
  <strong>Virginia</strong> and was the first suggested framework of the
  Constitution.&nbsp; It said that a state's representation in Congress should
  be based upon the state's population.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>New Jersey</strong> presented the "<strong>small-state plan</strong
  >."&nbsp; It centered on equal representation in Congress without regards to a
  state's size or population.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  A "<strong>Great Compromise</strong>" was eventually agreed upon.&nbsp; It
  called for representation by population in the
  <strong>House of Representatives</strong>, and equal representation in the
  <strong>Senate</strong>.&nbsp; Each state would have 2 senators.&nbsp; The new
  <strong>Constitution </strong>also called for a President.&nbsp; Because of
  arguments over if the slaves would count towards the general population of the
  state, the "<strong>three-fifths compromise</strong>" was created.&nbsp; The
  new Constitution also called for the
  <strong>end of the slave trade by the end of 1807. </strong> All new state
  constitutions except Georgia's forbade overseas slave trade.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Constitution was meant to be a broad document. It grew out of
  <strong>common law</strong>, in which it is unnecessary to be specific about
  every possible detail.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Rhode Island was not present at the Constitutional Convention.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Safeguards for Conservatism</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The members of the Constitutional Convention <strong>agreed</strong>
  <strong>economically</strong> (they demanded sound money and the protection of
  private property), and they <strong>agreed</strong>
  <strong>politically</strong> (they favored a stronger government with 3
  branches and with checks and balances system).
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Clash of Federalists and Anti-federalists</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>Anti-federalists</strong> opposed the stronger federal government
  because they feared it would take away the power of the common man. They were
  led by <u>Samuel Adams</u>, <u> Patrick Henry</u>, and
  <u>Richard Henry Lee</u>.&nbsp; The anti-federalists mostly consisted of the
  poorest class.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>Federalists</strong> were led by <u>George Washington</u> and
  <u> Benjamin Franklin</u>.&nbsp; Most of the Federalists lived in the settled
  areas along the seaboard.&nbsp; Overall, they were wealthier, more educated,
  and better organized than the anti-federalists.&nbsp; They also controlled the
  press.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Great Debate in the States</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts,
  Maryland, South Carolina, and New Hampshire were the first 9 states to sign
  the Constitution.&nbsp; Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island
  were the only states to not sign it.&nbsp; (<b>4 Laggard States</b>)
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Four Laggard States</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Virginia and New York eventually ratified the Constitution before it was put
  into effect.&nbsp; Rhode Island and North Carolina were the last states to
  ratify it, and they did so only after the new government had been in operation
  for a few months.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  These 4 states did not want to ratify the Constitution, but they could not
  safely exist as the only states "outside of the fold."
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A Conservative Triumph</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The architects of the Constitution believed that every branch (executive,
  judiciary, and legislative) effectively represented the people.

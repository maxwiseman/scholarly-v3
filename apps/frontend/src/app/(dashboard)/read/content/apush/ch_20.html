<p class="MsoNormal">Girding for War:&nbsp; The North and the South</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1861-1865</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Menace of Secession</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Abraham Lincoln declared that secession was 
impractical because the North and South were not geographically divided.&nbsp; He 
also stated that with secession, new controversies would arise, including the 
national debt, federal territories, and the fugitive-slave issue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>South Carolina Assails Fort Sumter</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When President Lincoln was elected, there were only two 
significant forts in the South that flew the Union's flag.&nbsp; <b>Fort Sumter</b>, 
in the Charleston harbor, needed supplies in order to support its men.&nbsp; 
Therefore, Lincoln adopted a <b>middle-of-the-road solution</b>.&nbsp; He told the 
South that the North was sending provisions to the fort, not supplies for 
reinforcement.&nbsp; Taking the move by Lincoln as an act of aggression, the South 
Carolinians fired upon Fort Sumter on <b>April 12, 1861</b>.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Virginia, Arkansas, and Tennessee all seceded after the 
attack on Fort Sumter.&nbsp; The 11 seceded states were known as the "<b>submissionists</b>."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lincoln now had a reason for an armed response. He 
  called upon the Union states to supply militiamen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Brothers' Blood and Border Blood</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and West Virginia 
  were the <strong>Border States</strong>.&nbsp; They were the only slave states that hadn't 
  seceded from the Union.&nbsp; The Border States contained the Ohio River, a vital 
  necessity for both the North and South. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lincoln's official reason for the war was to <strong>preserve the Union</strong>, not to end slavery. Supporting an end to slavery would likely have caused the pro-slavery Border States to also secede.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Five Civilized Tribes </strong>(Native American) 
  (Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Seminoles) sided with the 
  Confederacy.&nbsp; These tribes were allowed to send delegates to the Confederate congress.&nbsp; Most of the Plains Indians sided with the Union.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Balance of Forces</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>South</strong> had the advantage of fighting defensively 
  on its own land and it did not have to win in order to preserve the 
  Confederacy; it just had to fight to a draw.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Abraham Lincoln offered <u>Robert E. Lee</u> to command the 
  Northern army, but Lee turned down the job after his home state 
  of <strong>Virginia</strong> seceded.&nbsp; <u>Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson</u> was Lee's chief lieutenant.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There were not a lot of factories in the South, but the 
South was able to seize federal weapons from the Union.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>North</strong> held ¾ of the nation's wealth and ¾ of 
  the nation's railroad system.&nbsp; It also had nearly twice as large of a population 
  as the South, partly because more European immigrants arrived in the North.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dethroning King Cotton</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The South counted on foreign intervention to help win the war.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The common people of Britain &amp; France supported the North, hoping to 
  end slavery.&nbsp; Because of this, these countries refrained from breaking the Union naval blockades.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The British manufacturers depended on cotton from the 
  South, but before the war, a surplus of cotton had 
  developed in Britain, allowing it to function without purchasing cotton from the 
  South.&nbsp; In <strong>1861</strong>, this cotton supply ran out and many British factory 
  workers were laid off.&nbsp; As Union armies penetrated the South, they sent cotton 
  to Britain. <strong>King Wheat</strong> and <strong>King Corn</strong>, which were produced in great 
  quantities in the North, proved to be more powerful than <strong>King Cotton</strong>.&nbsp; 
  Therefore, Britain couldn't afford to break the Union blockade to access cotton. If it had done this, then it would have lost the wheat and corn from the North.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Decisiveness of Diplomacy</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong><em>Trent</em> affair</strong> occurred in late <strong>1861</strong>.&nbsp; 
  A Union warship stopped a British mail steamer, the <strong><em>Trent</em></strong>, and 
  removed 2 Confederate diplomats who were heading to Europe.&nbsp; Britain started to 
  send troops to Canada in retaliation, but the situation was resolved when President 
  Lincoln freed the Confederate prisoners.</p>
<p>British shipyards were surreptitiously producing Confederate 
  commerce-raiders.&nbsp; The British ships left their ports unarmed, picked up arms 
  elsewhere, and captured Union ships.&nbsp; One notable ship was the <strong><em>Alabama</em></strong>. The British attempted to end this practice in 1863.</p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Foreign Flare-Ups</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In <strong>1863</strong>, two Confederate warships were being 
  built by a British shipyard.&nbsp; These ships had large 
  iron rams would have destroyed the Union blockade.&nbsp; To avoid infuriating the 
  North and potentially starting a war, the London government bought the ships for the Royal Navy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The British established the <strong>Dominion of Canada</strong> in <strong> 1867</strong>.&nbsp; It was partly designed to strengthen the Canadians against the 
  possible vengeance of the United States.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Emperor Napoleon III</u> of France installed a French government in <strong>Mexico City</strong> in <strong>1863</strong>.&nbsp; <u>Maximilian</u> was the French emperor of Mexico City.&nbsp; These actions were in direct violation of 
  the Monroe Doctrine.&nbsp; Napoleon hoped that the Union would not retaliate due to 
  its weakness from fighting the Civil War. When the Civil War ended in 1865, though, America threatened to invade Mexico. Napoleon was forced to abandon 
  Maximilian and Mexico City.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>President Davis versus President Lincoln</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>one </strong><strong>defect</strong> <strong>of the South's constitution</strong> was that its own 
  states could secede.&nbsp; Some state troops refused to serve outside their borders.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>President Jefferson Davis</u> of the Confederacy often 
had disputes with his own congress.&nbsp; Davis's task as President proved to be 
beyond his powers.&nbsp; Lincoln and the North enjoyed a long-established government 
that was financially stable and fully recognized at home and abroad.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Limitations on Wartime Liberties</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because <strong>Congress was not in session</strong> when the war started, President Lincoln took several actions that normally had to be approved by Congress. He initiated a blockade, increased the 
  size of the Federal army, directed the secretary of the Treasury to advance $2 
  million without appropriation or security to 3 private citizens for military 
  purposes, and suspended the <strong>writ of </strong><strong>habeas corpus</strong> (stated that a citizen could 
  not be held without a trial).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Volunteers and Draftees:&nbsp; North and South</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Due to lack of volunteers, Congress passed  a federal draft law in <strong>1863</strong>.&nbsp; Men who were called in the draft could pay $300 to buy a replacement. The Confederacy also passed a draft law.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Economic Stresses of War</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The North increased tariffs and excise taxes to financially 
support the war.&nbsp; It also created the first income tax.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In early <strong>1861</strong>, after enough anti-tariff Southern 
  members had seceded, Congress passed the <strong>Morrill Tariff Act</strong>.&nbsp; It was a 
  high protective tariff that increased duties by 5%-10%.&nbsp;This was designed to raise additional revenue and provide more protection for the 
  Northern manufacturers.&nbsp; A <strong>protective tariff</strong> became identified with the <strong>Republican Party</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Washington Treasury issued paper money.&nbsp; 
  The <strong>greenback</strong> currency was not backed by gold; it was backed by the Union's perceived credit. Because of this, the value of the greenback was constantly changing. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In <strong>1863</strong>, Congress authorized the <strong>National Banking 
  System</strong>.&nbsp; It was designed to stimulate the sale of government bonds and to 
  establish a standard currency.&nbsp; Banks who joined the National Banking 
  System could buy government bonds and issue paper money that was backed by the 
  bonds.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Confederate government also issued bonds and raised taxes. It was forced to print <strong> blue-backed</strong> paper money that was subject to <strong>runaway inflation</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The North's Economic Boom</b></p>
<p>Newly invented, labor-saving machinery enabled the North to 
  expand economically.&nbsp; <strong>Mechanical reapers</strong> (farm machines used to harvest 
  grain) allowed men to leave the farms for the war, while increasing harvesting capacity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Petroleum</strong> was discovered in Pennsylvania in <strong> 1859</strong> and it led to a rush of people known as the "<strong>Fifty-Niners</strong>." The <strong>Homestead Act</strong> of 1862 provided free land to many people.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Civil War opened up many jobs for women that were 
  originally occupied by men. The <strong>U.S. Sanitary Commission</strong> was organized by women to provide medical support to Union armies in the field.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A Crashed Cotton Kingdom</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The North's blockade severely hampered the South's 
economy.&nbsp; Transportation in the South collapsed during the Civil War.&nbsp; <b>Cotton 
capitalism</b> had lost out to <b>industrial capitalism</b>.</p>

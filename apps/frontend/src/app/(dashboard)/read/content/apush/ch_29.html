<h3>Chapter 29</h3>
<h4>Wilsonian Progressivism at Home and Abroad</h4>
<h4>1912-1916</h4>
<hr />
<p>
  Woodrow Wilson became the governor of New Jersey by campaigning against trusts
  and promising to return the state government to the people.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The "Bull Moose" Campaign of 1912</b></p>
<p>
  The Democrats chose <u>Woodrow Wilson</u> as their presidential candidate for
  the <b>election of 1912</b>.&nbsp; The Democrats saw Wilson as a reformist
  leader who could beat the Republican party's candidate, Taft.&nbsp; The
  Democrats had a strong <b>progressive</b> <b>platform</b> that called for
  stronger antitrust laws, banking reform, and tariff reductions (<strong
    >New Freedom</strong
  >
  program). They favored small enterprise, entrepreneurship, and the free
  functioning of unregulated and unmonopolized markets, but they did not support
  social-welfare programs that Roosevelt supported.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Theodore Roosevelt</u> ran again in the election as a 3<sup>rd</sup> party
  candidate for the
  <strong>Progressive Republican party</strong>.&nbsp;Roosevelt ran ran with a
  <b>New Nationalism</b> program, which supported stronger control of trusts,
  woman suffrage, and programs of social welfare.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Both candidates favored a more active government role in economic and social
  affairs, but they disagreed over specific strategies.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Roosevelt was shot during the campaign, he recovered after a couple of weeks.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Woodrow Wilson:&nbsp; A Minority President</b></p>
<p>
  Taft and Roosevelt split the Republican votes, giving Woodrow Wilson the
  presidency.
</p>
<p>
  Roosevelt's Progressive Party died out because it did not have any elected
  officials in state and local offices.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Wilson:&nbsp; The Idealist in Politics</b></p>
<p>
  Wilson relied on sincerity and moral appeal to attract the public.&nbsp; He
  was smart, but he didn't have people skills. Wilson's idealism and sense of
  moral righteousness made him incredibly stubborn in negotiating.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Wilson Tackles the Tariff</b></p>
<p>
  President Wilson was determined to attack "<b>the triple wall of privilege</b
  >":&nbsp; the <strong>tariff</strong>, the <strong>banks</strong>, and the
  <strong>trusts</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Wilson called a special meeting of Congress in <b>1913</b> to address the
  tariff.&nbsp; He convinced Congress to pass the <b>Underwood Tariff Bill</b>,
  which significantly reduced the tariff.&nbsp; The
  <strong>16<sup>th</sup> Amendment </strong>was ratified in 1913. This enabled
  Congress to collect a <b>graduated</b> <b> income tax</b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Wilson Battles the Bankers</b></p>
<p>
  The most serious problem of the National Banking Act (passed during the Civil
  War) was the inelasticity of money. In times of financial stress, banking
  reserves, which were located in New York and other large cities, could not
  distribute money fast enough into areas of need.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1913</b>, Congress passed the <b>Federal Reserve Act</b>.&nbsp; The
  new<b> Federal Reserve Board</b>, appointed by the President, oversaw a
  nationwide system of 12 regional Federal Reserve banks.&nbsp; Each reserve
  bank was the central bank for its region.&nbsp; The final authority of the
  Federal Reserve Board guaranteed a substantial level of public control.&nbsp;
  The board could also issue paper money, called
  <b>Federal Reserve Notes</b> (the U.S. Dollar).&nbsp; Because of this, the
  amount of money in circulation could be increased as needed for the
  requirements of business.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The President Tames the Trusts</b></p>
<p>
  Congress passed the <b>Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914</b>.&nbsp; This
  law created the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which oversaw industries
  engaged in interstate commerce. This organization could issue cease-and-desist
  orders to companies engaged in unfair business tactics.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Clayton Antitrust Act of</b> <b>1914</b> lengthened the Sherman Act's
  list of business practices that were deemed objectionable.&nbsp; It also
  sought to exempt labor and agricultural organizations from antitrust
  prosecution, while legalizing strikes and peaceful picketing.&nbsp; Union
  leader <u> Samuel Gompers</u> supported the act.

<p><b>Wilsonian Progressivism at High Tide</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916</b> made low-interest rate loans
  available to farmers.&nbsp; The <b>Warehouse Act of 1916 </b> enabled farmers
  to take out loans against the value of their staple crops, which were stored
  in government warehouses.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>La Follette Seamen's Act of 1915</b> benefited sailors by requiring
  decent treatment and a living wage on American ships.
</p>
<p>
  President Wilson assisted the workers with the
  <b> Workingmen's Compensation Act of 1916</b>, giving assistance to federal
  civil-service employees during periods of disability.&nbsp; Also in 1916, the
  President approved an act restricting <b>child</b> <b>labor</b> on products
  flowing into interstate commerce.&nbsp; The
  <b>Adamson Act of 1916</b> established an 8-hour work day for all employees on
  trains in interstate commerce.
</p>
<p>
  Wilson nominated <u>Louis D. Brandeis</u> to the Supreme Court. He was a
  progressive reformer, and he was the first Jew to be a Supreme Court justice.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>New Directions in Foreign Policy</b></p>
<p>
  President Wilson was an anti-imperialist and he opposed an aggressive foreign
  policy.
</p>
<p>
  He persuaded Congress in <b>1914</b> to <b>repeal</b> the
  <b>Panama Canal Tolls Act of 1912</b>, which had exempted American coastal
  shipping from tolls.&nbsp; He also signed the <b>Jones Act</b> in <b>1916</b>,
  which granted the Philippines territorial status and promised independence as
  soon as a stable government could be established.
</p>
<p>
  When political turmoil broke out in <b>Haiti</b> in <b>1915</b>, Wilson
  dispatched marines to protect American lives and property.&nbsp; In
  <b>1916</b>, he signed a treaty with Haiti that provided for U.S. supervision
  of finances and the police.
</p>
<p>In <b>1917</b>, Wilson purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Moralistic Diplomacy in Mexico</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1913</b>, a <b>Mexican</b> <b>revolution</b> occurred and the Mexican
  president was murdered and replaced by <u>General Victoriano Huerta</u>. He
  was a brutal dictator. Because of the chaos in Mexico, millions of
  Spanish-speaking immigrants came to America.
</p>
<p>
  President Wilson initially refused to directly intervene with the war in
  Mexico; he wanted the Mexican citizens to overthrow their government,
  themselves. After a small party of American sailors was accidentally captured
  by the Mexicans (<strong>Tampico Incident</strong>), Wilson ordered the navy
  to seize the Mexican port of Vera Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  Just as war seemed imminent with Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile
  intervened and pressured Huerta to step down.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Venustiano Carranza</u> became the president of Mexico.&nbsp;
  <u>Francisco Villa</u>, rival to President Carranza, attempted to provoke a
  war between Mexico and the U.S by killing Americans.&nbsp; Wilson ordered
  <u> General John J. Perishing</u> to break up Villa's band of outlaws.&nbsp;
  The invading American army was withdrawn from Mexico in <b>1917</b> as the
  threat of war with Germany loomed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Thunder Across the Sea</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1914</b>,<b> World War I</b> broke out when the heir to the throne of
  Austria-Hungary was murdered by a Serb patriot.&nbsp; An outraged Vienna
  government (backed by Germany) presented a series of demands to Serbia.&nbsp;
  Serbia (backed by Russia) refused to comply.&nbsp; Russia mobilized its army,
  causing Germany to also mobilize its army.
</p>
<p>
  France initially implied that it would be neutral in the Germany-Russia
  conflict. But, as Germany was bordered on both sides by potential enemies, it
  decided to first defeat France so that it could focus on fighting Russia. The
  <b>Central Powers</b> consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and
  Bulgaria.&nbsp; The <b>Allies</b> consisted of France, Britain, Russia, Japan,
  and Italy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A Precarious Neutrality</b></p>
<p>
  President Wilson issued the neutrality proclamation at the outbreak of WWI.
</p>
<p>
  Most Americans were anti-German from the start of the war. Americans viewed
  <u>Kaiser Wilhelm II</u>, the leader of Germany, as the embodiment of arrogant
  autocracy.&nbsp; The majority of Americans were opposed to war.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>America Earns Blood Money</b></p>
<p>
  American industry prospered off trade with the Allies.&nbsp; The Central
  Powers protested American trade with the Allies, but America wasn't breaking
  any international neutrality laws. Germany was free to trade with the U.S.,
  but Britain prevented this trade by controlling the Atlantic Ocean through
  which Germany had to cross to trade with the U.S.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1915</b>, several months after Germany started to use submarines in the
  war (<strong>U-boats</strong>), one of Germany's submarines sunk the British
  ship,<b><i> Lusitania</i></b
  >, killing 128 Americans.
</p>
<p>
  Americans demanded war but President Wilson firmly opposed war.&nbsp; When
  Germany sunk another British ship, the <b><i> Arabic</i></b
  >, in <b>1915</b>, Berlin agreed to not sink unarmed passenger ships<em>
    without warning</em
  >.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  After Germany sunk a French passenger steamer, the <i> Sussex</i>, Germany
  agreed to the <b><i>Sussex</i> pledge</b>, which again said that Germany would
  not sink unarmed ships without warning. A German caveat to this pledge was
  that the U.S. would have to convince the Allies to stop their trade blockade.
  This was not possible, so war with Germany became imminent.

<p><b>Wilson Wins the Reelection in 1916</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  The Progressive Party and the Republican Party met in 1916 to choose their
  presidential candidate.&nbsp; Although nominated by the Progressives,
  <u>Theodore Roosevelt</u> refused to run for president because he didn't want
  to split the party again.&nbsp; The Republicans chose Supreme Court justice
  <u>Charles Evans Hughes</u>.&nbsp; The Republican platform condemned the
  Democratic tariff, assaults on the trusts, and Wilson's dealings with Mexico
  and Germany.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  The Democrats chose Wilson and ran an anti-war campaign.&nbsp;
  <u>Woodrow Wilson</u> won the <b>election of 1916</b>.

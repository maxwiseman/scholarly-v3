<p class="MsoNormal">The Rise of a Mass Democracy</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1824-1840</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Democrat</strong> party emerged in <strong>1828</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The "Corrupt Bargain" of 1824</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well-organized parties had not yet emerged, and there were 4 main "Republican" candidates in the <strong> election of 1824</strong>:&nbsp; <u>Andrew Jackson</u>, <u>John Quincy Adams</u>, <u> William Crawford</u>, and <u>Henry Clay</u>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>No candidate won the majority of the electoral votes</strong>, 
  so, according to the Constitution, the House of Representatives had to choose 
  the winner out of the top 3 candidates.&nbsp; <u>Henry Clay</u> was eliminated because he received the 4th most votes. Being  the <strong>Speaker of the House</strong>, though, he did have much say in who became president. Clay convinced 
  the House to elect <u>John Quincy Adams</u> as president.&nbsp; Adams agreed to make 
  Clay the <strong>Secretary of State</strong> for getting him into office. &nbsp;The 
  public felt that a "<strong>corrupt bargain</strong>" had taken place because Andrew 
  Jackson had received the popular vote.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A Yankee Misfit in the White House</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">John Quincy Adams was a <b>strong nationalist </b>and he 
supported the building of national roads and canals.&nbsp; He also supported 
education.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Going "Whole Hog" for Jackson in 1828</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before the election of 1824, two parties had formed: <strong> National Republicans </strong>and <strong>Democratic-Republicans</strong> (also referred to as just "Democrat"). <strong>Adams and Clay </strong>were the figures of the <strong>National Republicans </strong>and <strong>Jackson </strong>was 
  with the <strong>Democratic-Republicans</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Andrew Jackson</u> beat Adams to win the <b>election of 
1828. </b>&nbsp;The majority of his support came from the South, while Adams's 
support came from the North.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>"Old Hickory" as President</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jackson was the first president from the West and the second president without a college education.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Spoils System</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the Democrats took control of the White House, they <strong>replaced most public officials </strong>with their own people (the common 
  man).&nbsp; These people were illiterate and incompetent.&nbsp; This system of rewarding 
  political supporters with jobs in the government was known as the "<strong>spoils 
    system</strong>."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Tricky "Tariff of Abominations"</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 1824, Congress significantly&nbsp;increased the tariff on imports.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The</strong> <strong>Tariff of 1828:</strong> called the "Black Tariff" 
  or the "Tariff of Abominations"; also called the "<strong>Yankee Tariff</strong>".&nbsp; It was 
  hated by Southerners because it was an extremely high tariff and they felt it 
  discriminated against them.&nbsp; The South was having economic struggles and they used the tariff as a scapegoat for their problems.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In <b>1822</b>, <u>Denmark Vesey</u> led a <b>slave 
rebellion</b> in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <b><i>South Carolina Exposition</i></b>, made by <u>
John C. Calhoun</u>, was published in <b>1828</b>.&nbsp; It was a pamphlet that 
denounced the Tariff of 1828 as unjust and 
unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"<b>Nullies" in the South</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In an attempt to meet the South's demands, Congress passed 
the <b>Tariff of 1832</b>, a slightly lower tariff compared to the Tariff of 
1828.&nbsp; It fell short of the South's demands.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The state legislature of South Carolina called for the <strong> Columbia</strong> <strong>Convention</strong>.&nbsp; The delegates of the convention called for the <strong>tariff to be void in South Carolina</strong>.&nbsp; The convention threatened to 
  take South Carolina out of the Union if the Federal government attempted to collect the 
  customs duties by force.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Henry Clay</u> introduced the <strong>Tariff of 1833. </strong> It <strong>gradually reduced</strong> the Tariff of 1832 by about <strong>10% over 8 
  years</strong>.&nbsp; By 1842, the rates would be back at the level of 1816.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>compromise Tariff of 1833</strong> ended the dispute over 
  the Tariff of 1832 between the South and the White House.&nbsp; The compromise was 
  supported by South Carolina but not much by the other southern states.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Prior to the compromise, Congress had passed the <strong>Force Bill,</strong> which authorized the Federal government to use force to collect the tariffs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Trail of Tears</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jackson's Democrats were committed to western expansion, 
but such expansion meant confrontation with the Indians who inhabited the land 
east of the Mississippi.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Society for Propagating the Gospel Among Indians </strong> was founded in <strong>1787</strong> to Christianize Indians.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>"F</strong><strong>ive Civilized Tribes" </strong>were the<strong> Cherokees, 
  Creeks, Choctaws, Chickasaws, </strong>and <strong>Seminoles</strong>. These tribes made efforts to assimilate into white culture. President Jackson 
  wanted to move the Indians so Americans could expand.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Despite Supreme Court rulings that consistently favored the Indians' land rights, Congress passed the <strong>Indian Removal Act in 1830</strong>.&nbsp; 
  It moved more than 100,000 Indians living east of the Mississippi to 
  reservations west of the Mississippi.&nbsp; Many Indians died on forced marches along the <strong>Trail of Tears</strong>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Black Hawk</u> led Indians to fight against the relocation in the <strong>Black Hawk War</strong> of 1832. The Indians were defeated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Seminoles in Florida </strong>retreated to the 
  Everglades, fighting for several years until they retreated deeper into the 
  Everglades or were moved to the Oklahoma area.</p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Bank War</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Andrew Jackson despised the Bank of the United 
States because he felt it was very <b>monopolistic</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Bank of the United States was a private institution that was not accountable to the people; it was only accountable to its investors.&nbsp; The bank <strong>minted gold and silver coins</strong>.&nbsp; <u>Nicholas Biddle</u>, the president of 
  the Bank of the United States, held an immense and possibly unconstitutional 
  amount of power over the nation's financial affairs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Bank War </strong>erupted in <strong>1832</strong> when <u>Daniel 
  Webster</u> and <u>Henry Clay</u> presented Congress with a bill to renew the 
  Bank's charter.&nbsp; Clay wanted to make it<strong> </strong>an 
  issue for the election<strong> </strong>of 1832.&nbsp; He felt that if Jackson signed off<strong> </strong>on the bill, then Jackson would <strong>alienate the people of the West</strong> who hated 
  the Bank.&nbsp; If Jackson<strong> </strong>vetoed the bill, then he would <strong>alienate the wealthy 
    class of the East </strong>who supported the Bank.&nbsp; Clay did not account for the fact 
  that the wealthy class was now a minority.&nbsp; Jackson vetoed the bill, calling the 
  Bank unconstitutional.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The veto showed that Jackson felt that the Executive Branch 
  had more power than the Judicial Branch<strong> </strong>in determining the 
  Constitutionality of the Bank of the United States. This was despite the fact that the Supreme Court had already ruled that the Bank was constitutional in<em> McCulloch vs. Maryland </em>(1819).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>"Old Hickory" Wallops Clay in 1833</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A third party entered the election in the election of 1832: <strong>The Anti-Masonic party</strong>.&nbsp; The party hated the Masonic Order, a secret society, because it thought the Order was comprised of privileged, elite people.&nbsp; Although Jackson was 
  supported egalitarianism and "the common man", he was a Mason himself; therefore the Anti-Masons were an <strong> anti-Jackson party</strong>.&nbsp; It gained support from evangelical Protestant groups.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Jacksonians (Democrats) were opposed to government involvement in social and economic life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Andrew Jackson</u> was reelected in<strong> 1832</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Burying Biddle's Bank</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Bank of the United States's charter expired in <strong>1836</strong>.&nbsp; 
  Jackson wanted to make sure that the Bank was destroyed.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In <strong>1833</strong>, 3 years before the Bank's charter expired, 
  Jackson decided to remove federal deposits from its vaults.&nbsp; Jackson proposed 
  depositing no more funds in the bank<strong> </strong>and he gradually shrunk existing 
  deposits<strong> </strong>by using the funds to pay for day-to-day expenditures of the 
  government.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The death of the Bank of the United States left a financial 
  vacuum in the American economy.&nbsp; Surplus federal funds were placed in several 
  dozen state banks that were politically supportive of Jackson (<strong>"pet banks"</strong>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Smaller, wildcat banks in the west had begun to issue their 
  own currency.&nbsp; But this "<strong>wildcat</strong>" currency was extremely unreliable 
  because its value was based upon the value of the bank from which it was issued.&nbsp; In <strong>1836</strong>, "wildcat"<strong> </strong>currency<strong> </strong>had become so<strong> unreliable</strong> that Jackson told the <strong>Treasury to issue a Specie Circular</strong>, a decree that 
  required all public lands to be purchased with metallic money.&nbsp; This drastic 
  step contributed greatly to the <strong>financial panic of 1837</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Birth of the Whigs</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Whigs were conservatives who supported government 
programs, reforms, and public schools.&nbsp; They called for<b> internal improvements
</b>like canals, railroads, and telegraph lines.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Whigs claimed to be defenders of the common man and 
  declared the Democrats the party of corruption. They absorbed the Anti-Masonic Party.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Election of 1836</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Martin Van Buren</u> was Andrew Jackson's choice as his 
  successor in the election of 1836. He won the election. <u>General William Henry Harrison</u> was 
  one of the Whig's many presidential nominees.&nbsp; The Whigs did not win because 
  they did not unite behind just one candidate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Depression Doldrums and the Independent Treasury</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>basic cause </strong>of the <strong>panic of 1837 </strong>was rampant speculation by banks. (Banks gave a lot of loans to people/businesses who, in the end, could not afford to repay the loans.) Jacksonian's financial policies also contributed to the panic. In <strong>1836</strong>, the failure of two British banks 
  caused British investors to call in foreign loans.&nbsp; These loans were the 
  beginning of the panic. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The panic of 1837 caused hundreds of banks to collapse, commodity 
  prices to drop, sales of public to fall, and the loss of jobs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Whigs proposed government policies to fix the economic downturn: expansion of bank credit, higher tariffs, subsidies for internal improvement. Van Buren rejected these proposals because he wanted to keep government involvement out of the economy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Van Buren proposed the <strong>Divorce Bill</strong>.&nbsp; Not passed by 
  Congress, it called for separating the government and banking.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <b>Independent Treasury Bill </b>was passed in <b>1840</b>.&nbsp; 
An independent treasury would be established and government funds would be 
locked in vaults.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Gone to Texas</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Mexico </strong>won its independence<strong> </strong>from Spain in <strong> 1821</strong>. Because of this, ownership of Texas passed from Spain to Mexico. Mexico gave a large chunk of Texas land to <u>Stephen Austin,</u> who promised to bring families into Texas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Texans differed in many ways from the Mexicans, including the fact that Mexicans were against slavery, while the Texans supported it.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Santa Anna:</u> dictator of Mexico; in 1835, he removed Texans' local rights and started to raise army to suppress the rebelling Texans.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Lone Star Rebellion</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Texas declared its independence in <strong>1836</strong>.&nbsp; <u>Sam 
  Houston:</u> commander in chief for Texas army.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">General Houston forced Santa Anna to sign a <strong>treaty in 
  1836</strong> after Houston had captured Santa Anna in the <strong>Battle of San Jacinto</strong>. The treaty defined the Rio Grande as the southwestern boundary of an independent Texas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Texans wanted to become a state in the United States, &nbsp;but the northerners did not want this because of the issue of slavery: admitting Texas would mean one more slave state.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Log Cabins and Hard Cider of 1840</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>William Henry Harrison</u> defeated Van Buren to win the <strong>election of 1840</strong> for the Whigs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Politics for the People</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There were <strong>2 major changes in politics</strong> after the Era 
  of Good Feelings that were highlighted by the election of 1840:&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">1) Politicians who were too clean, too well dressed, too grammatical, and 
too intellectual were not liked. Aristocracy was not liked by the 
American people.&nbsp; The <b>common man </b>was moving to the center of 
the&nbsp;national political stage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Two-Party System</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">2) There was a formation of a <strong>two-party system</strong>.&nbsp; The two parties 
  consisted of the <strong>Democrats </strong>and<strong> </strong>the<strong> Whigs</strong> (the National Republican 
  Party had died out).&nbsp; Jacksonian <strong>Democrats</strong> supported individual liberties, states' rights, and federal restraint in social and 
  economic affairs.&nbsp; The <strong>Whigs </strong>supported the natural harmony of society and 
  the value of community, a renewed national bank, protective 
  tariffs, internal improvements, public schools, and moral reforms, such as the 
  prohibition of liquor and the abolition of slavery.</p>

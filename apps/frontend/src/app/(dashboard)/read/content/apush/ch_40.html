<h3>Chapter 40</h3>
<h4>The Resurgence of Conservatism</h4>

<h4>1980-1992</h4>

<hr />
<p>
  By the 1980s, the American population was aging and more people were living in
  the South and West. The led to the emergence of a new politically conservative
  movement.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Election of Ronald Reagan, 1980</b></p>
<p>
  <u>Ronald Reagan</u> was a <strong>neoconservative</strong> who opposed a big
  government, supported the "common man's" rights, and opposed favoritism for
  minorities. He tried to spin the Democrats as a party who supported big
  government and only supported minorities. Like neoconservatives, he also
  supported free-market capitalism, supported anti-Soviet policies, opposed
  liberal welfare programs and affirmative-action policies, and he called for
  the reassertion of traditional values of individualism and the centrality of
  family.
</p>

<p>
  <u>Ronald Reagan</u> overwhelmingly won the <b>election of 1980</b>, beating
  Democratic president <u>Jimmy Carter</u>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Reagan Revolution</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>Iranian's</b> released the <b>hostages</b> on Reagan's Inauguration
  Day, January 20, 1981, after 444 days of captivity.
</p>

<p>Reagan assembled a conservative cabinet when he took office.</p>

<p>
  A major goal of Reagan was to <b>reduce the size of the government</b> by
  <b>shrinking</b> the <b>federal budget</b> and <b>cutting taxes</b>.&nbsp; He
  proposed a new federal budget that called for <strong>cuts</strong> of $35
  billion, mostly in <strong>social programs</strong>, including food stamps and
  federally-funded job-training centers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  On <b>March 6, 1981</b>, Reagan was <b>shot</b>.&nbsp; 12 days later, Reagan
  recovered and returned to work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Battle of the Budget</b></p>

<p>
  Reagan called for substantial <b>tax cuts</b>, and in August 1981, Congress
  approved a set of tax reforms that lowered individual tax rates, reduced
  federal estate taxes, and created new tax-free saving plans for small
  investors.
</p>
<p>
  Reagan supported "<b>supply-side</b>"<b> economics</b>: reducing taxes will
  enable businesses to produce more goods, which will lower prices, increase
  consumer spending, and create more jobs. Reagan believed that this would
  stimulate new investment, boost productivity, promote dramatic economic
  growth, and reduce the federal deficit. (<strong>Reaganomics</strong>)
</p>
<p>
  In 1981-1982, the economy slipped into a recession as unemployment rose and
  banks closed. The anti-inflationary polices that caused the
  <b> recession of 1982</b> had actually been created by the Federal Reserve
  Board in 1979, during Carter's presidency.
</p>
<p>
  During the 1980s, <b> income gaps</b> <b>widened</b> between the rich and the
  poor.
</p>
<p>
  By the mid-1980s, the economy had recovered. Economists speculated that the
  economy had recovered because of Reagan's massive
  <strong>military expenditure</strong><b>s</b>.&nbsp; Reagan gave the Pentagon
  nearly $2 trillion in the 1980s.&nbsp;This massive expenditure led to an
  unbalanced federal budget and it
  <strong>substantially increased the national debt</strong>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reagan Renews the Cold War</b></p>

<p>
  Reagan's <b>strategy</b> for dealing with the Soviet Union was to
  <strong>initiate a new arms race and outspend the Soviets</strong>. He
  expected that the American economy could better support an expensive arms race
  than the Soviet Union's economy.
</p>
<p>
  In March 1983, Reagan announced a missile-defense system called the
  <b>Strategic Defense Initiative </b>(<b>SDI</b>), also known as
  <b>Star Wars</b>.&nbsp; The plan called for orbiting battle satellites in
  space that could fire laser beams to shoot down intercontinental missiles.
</p>

<p>
  In 1981, the USSR declared martial law in Poland. In <b>1983</b>, a Korean
  passenger <b>airliner</b> was shot down when it flew into Soviet
  airspace.&nbsp; By the end of 1983, all arms-control negotiations were broken,
  and the Cold War was intensified.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Troubles Abroad</b></p>

<p>
  In June <b>1982</b>, <b>Israel</b> invaded <b>Lebanon</b>, seeking to destroy
  the guerilla bases from which Palestinian fighters attacked Israel.&nbsp;
  Reagan sent peacekeeping troops, but after a suicide bomber killed 200
  marines, he withdrew the force.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1979</b>, Reagan sent "military advisors" to <b>El Salvador</b> to
  support the pro-American government.&nbsp; In <b>October 1983</b>, he sent
  forces to the island of <b> Grenada</b>, where a military coup had killed the
  prime minister and brought Marxists to power.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Round Two for Reagan</b></p>

<p>
  <u>Ronald Reagan</u> overwhelmingly won the <b>election of 1984</b>, beating
  Democrat <u>Walter Mondale</u> and his female vice presidential nominee,
  <u>Geraldine Ferraro</u>.
</p>

<p>Foreign policy issues dominated Reagan's second term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <u>Mikhail Gorbachev</u> became the leader of the Soviet Union in
  1985.&nbsp;He was committed to reforming the country with two policies:<b
    ><i> Glasnost</i></b
  >
  sought to allow free speech and political freedom and
  <b><i> Perestroika</i></b> sought to adopt capitalistic economic policies.
  These two policies required the Soviet Union to reduce the size of its
  military and concentrate aid on its citizens.&nbsp;
  <strong>This necessitated an end to the Cold War</strong>.&nbsp; In
  <b>December 1985</b>, Reagan and Gorbachev signed the
  <b>Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty</b>, banning all
  intermediate-range nuclear missiles from Europe.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Iran-Contra Imbroglio</b></p>

<p>
  Reagan was plagued by 2 problems: American hostages were held by Muslim
  extremists in Lebanon, and <strong>Nicaragua</strong> was run by a left-wing
  <strong>Sandinista</strong> government. To circumvent Congress's ban on
  sending arms to the Nicaraguan rebels who fought Sandinista, the Reagan
  administration secretly sold arms to <strong>Iran</strong> (who helped free
  hostages) and then diverted the money from the sales to the rebels.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>November 1986</b>, news of the <b>secret dealings</b> broke and ignited
  a firestorm of controversy.&nbsp; Reagan claimed he had no idea of the illicit
  activities.&nbsp; <b>Criminal indictments</b> were brought against
  <u>Oliver North</u>, <u>Admiral John Poindexter</u>, and
  <u>Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger</u>.&nbsp; The
  <b>Iran-contra affair</b> cast a shadow over Reagan's record in foreign
  policy.

<p><b>Reagan's Economic Legacy</b></p>

<p>
  Reagan's tax cuts and huge increases in military spending caused
  <b>$200 billion in annual deficits</b>, which added $2 trillion to the
  national debt during Reagan's administration. However, Reagan's large budget
  deficits helped make future social welfare programs seem economically
  infeasible. Thus, Reagan had achieved his goal of limiting the expansion of
  welfare programs.
</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, <b>median household income</b> declined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Religious Right</b></p>

<p>
  In <b>1979</b>, <u>Reverend Jerry Falwell</u> founded a political organization
  called the <b>Moral Majority</b>.&nbsp; He preached against sexual
  permissiveness, abortion, feminism, and the spread of gay rights.&nbsp; The
  organization became an aggressive political advocate of conservative causes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Conservatism in the Courts</b></p>

<p>
  By the time he had left office, Reagan had appointed
  <b> 3 conservative-minded judges</b>, including <u>Sandra Day O'Connor</u>,
  the first women to become a Supreme Court Justice.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Reagan sought to use the Supreme Court to fight <b>affirmative action</b> and
  <b>abortion</b>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <b>Affirmative Action</b> - In two cases in <b>1989</b> (<b
    ><i>Ward's Cove Packing v. Antonia</i></b
  >
  and <b><i>Martin v. Wilks</i></b
  >), the Court made it more difficult to prove that an employer practiced
  racial discrimination in hiring.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <b>Abortion</b> - In <b><i>Roe v. Wade</i></b> (<b>1973</b>), the Court had
  prohibited states from making laws that interfered with a woman's right to an
  abortion during the early months of pregnancy.&nbsp; In
  <b><i>Webster v. Reproductive Health Services</i></b> (<b>1989</b>), the
  Supreme Court approved a Missouri law that imposed certain restrictions on
  abortion, signalling that a state could legislate in an area in which
  <i>Roe</i> had previously forbidden them to legislate.&nbsp; In
  <b><i>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</i></b> (<b>1992</b>), the Court ruled that
  states could restrict access to abortion as long they did not place an "undue
  burden" on the woman.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Referendum on Reagansim in 1988</b></p>

<p>
  <b>Corruption</b> in the government gave Democrats political
  opportunities.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  On "<b>Black Monday</b>," <b>October 19, 1987</b>, the stock market dropped
  508 points, which was the largest one-day decline in history.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  The Republicans nominated <u>George H. W. Bush</u> for the
  <b> election of 1988</b>.&nbsp; The Democrats chose <u>Michael Dukakis</u>.
  Despite Reagan's recent problems in office, <b>George H. W. Bush</b>
  <b> won</b> the election.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>George H. W. Bush and the End of the Cold War</b></p>

<p>
  In <b>1989</b>, thousands of <b>pro-democracy demonstrators</b> protested in
  <b>Tiananmen Square</b> in <b>China</b>.&nbsp; In June of 1989, China's
  autocratic rulers brutally crushed the movement.
</p>

<p>
  In 1989, several communist regimes in Europe collapsed, including
  <strong>Poland</strong>,<b> Hungary</b>, <b>Czechoslovakia</b>,
  <b>East Germany</b>, and <b>Romania</b>. In <b>December 1989</b>, the
  <b>Berlin Wall</b> came down, and the two Germanies were reunited in
  <b>October 1990</b>.
</p>

<p>
  In <b>August 1991</b>, a <b>military</b> <b>coup</b> attempted to preserve the
  communist system by trying to overthrow <u>Gorbachev</u>.&nbsp;In December
  1991, <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>resigned</b> as the Soviet Union's president, as the
  Soviet Union had dissolved into its component parts, 15 republics loosely
  confederated in the <b>Commonwealth of Independent States</b> (<b>CIS</b>),
  with Russia as the most powerful state. <u>Boris Yelstin,</u> the president of
  the Russian Republic, was the dominant leader of the CIS. The demise of the
  Soviet Union <strong>ended the Cold War</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Ethnic warfare broke out throughout the former Soviet Union. In <b>1991</b>,
  the <b>Chechen minority</b> tried to declare its independence from
  <b>Russia</b>, but Yelstin sent in Russian troops.
</p>

<p>
  As a result of reduced defense spending after the Cold War, <b>America's</b>
  <b>economy</b> <b>suffered</b>.
</p>

<p>
  In <b>1990</b>, the white regime in <b>South Africa</b> freed African leader
  <u>Nelson Mandela</u>, who had served 27 years in prison for conspiring for
  overthrow the government.&nbsp; Four years later, he was elected as South
  Africa's president.&nbsp; In <b>1990</b>, free elections removed the
  <b> leftist</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> in <b>Nicaragua</b> from power.&nbsp; In
  1992, the civil war ended in <b>El Salvador</b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Persian Gulf Crisis</b></p>

<p>
  On August 2, 1990, <b>Iraqi</b> leader <u>Saddam Hussein</u> <b>invaded</b>
  <b>Kuwait</b>, seeking oil.&nbsp; The United Nations Security Council
  condemned the invasion and on August 3, it demanded the immediate withdrawal
  of Iraq's troops.&nbsp; After Hussein refused to comply by the mandatory date
  of <b> January 15, 1991</b>, the United States led a massive international
  military deployment, sending 539,000 troops to the Persian Gulf region.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>January 16, 1991</b>, the U.S. and the U.N. launched a 37-day air war
  against Iraq.&nbsp; Allied commander, American general
  <u>Norman Schwarzkopf</u>, planned to bombing the Iraqis and then send in
  ground troops and armor. On <b>February 23</b>, the land war, "<b
    >Operation Desert Storm</b
  >," began.&nbsp; It only lasted 4 days, and Saddam Hussein was forced to sign
  a cease-fire on <b>February 27</b>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Because the allies had only agreed to liberate Kuwait, Bush decided not to
  invade Baghdad to overthrow Saddam. Thus, Saddam stayed in power.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Bush on the Home Front</b></p>
<p>
  President Bush signed the <b>Americans with Disabilities Act</b> (<b>ADA</b>)
  in <b>1990</b>, prohibiting discrimination against citizens with physical or
  mental disabilities.&nbsp; In <b>1992</b>, he signed a major
  <b> water projects bill</b> that reformed the distribution of subsidized
  federal water in the West.&nbsp; In 1990, Bush's Department of Education
  challenged the legality of college scholarships targeted for racial
  minorities.
</p>

<p>
  In <b>1991</b>, Bush nominated conservative African American
  <u>Clarence Thomas</u> to the <b>Supreme Court</b>. He opposed affirmative
  action. Thomas's nomination was approved by the Senate despite accusations
  from <u>Anita Hill</u> that Thomas had sexually harassed her.
</p>

<p>
  By 1992, the unemployment rate had exceeded 7% and the federal budget deficit
  continued to grow. Bush was forced to increase taxes to generate revenue for
  the federal government.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Bill Clinton: &nbsp;The First Baby-Boomer President</b>
</p>
<p>
  For the <b>election of 1992</b>, the Democrats chose <u>Bill Clinton</u> as
  their candidate (despite accusations of womanizing and draft evasion) and
  <u> Albert Gore, Jr.</u> as his running mate.&nbsp; The Democrats tried a new
  approach, promoting growth, strong defense, and anticrime policies, while
  campaigning to stimulate the economy.
</p>
<p>
  The Republicans dwelled on "family values" and selected <u>Bush</u> for the
  presidency and <u>J. Danforth Quayle</u> for the vice presidency.
</p>
<p>
  Third party candidate, <u>Ross Perot</u> entered the race and ended up winning
  19,237,247 votes, although he won no Electoral votes.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  <b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> the election of 1992. Democrats also gained control
  of both the House and the Senate.
</p>

<p>
  Presidency Clinton hired <b>minorities</b> and more <b>women</b> in Congress
  and his presidential cabinet. This included the first female attorney general,
  <u>Janet Reno</u>, Secretary of Health and Human Services,
  <u>Donna Shalala</u>, and <u> Ruth Bader Ginsburg</u> in the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>A False Start for Reform</b>
</p>

<p>
  Clinton called for accepting homosexuals in the armed forces, but he had to
  settle for a "<strong>don't ask, don't tell</strong>" policy that unofficially
  accepted gays and lesbians.
</p>
<p>
  Clinton appointed his wife, <u>Hillary Rodham Clinton</u>, to revamp the
  nation's health and medical care system.&nbsp; When the plan was revealed in
  October 1993, critics blasted it as cumbersome, confusing, and stupid.&nbsp;
  The previous image of Hillary as an equal political partner of her husband
  changed to a liability.
</p>

<p>
  In <b>1993</b>, Clinton passed the <b>Brady Bill</b>, a gun-control law named
  after presidential aide <u>James Brady</u>, who had been shot in President
  Reagan's attempted assassination.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  By <b>1998</b>, Clinton 's policies had led to
  <strong>budget surplus</strong> and he had <b>shrunk</b> the <b>federal</b>
  <b>deficit</b> to its lowest levels in ten years.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  On February 26, 1993, a radical Muslim group bombed the
  <b>World Trade Center</b> in New York, killing six people.&nbsp; On April 19,
  1993, a standoff at <b> Waco, Texas</b> between the government and the
  <b>Branch Davidian cult </b> ended in a fire that killed 82 people. On April
  19, 1995, <u> Timothy McVeigh</u> bombed a federal building in<strong>
    Oklahoma City</strong
  >, killing 169 people.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>The Politics of Distrust</b>
</p>

<p>
  In 1994, <u>Newt Gingrich</u> led Republicans on an attack of Clinton's
  liberal failures with a conservative "<b>Contract with America</b>."
  &nbsp;That year, Republicans won eight more seats in the Senate and 53 more
  seats in the House, where Gingrich became the new Speaker of the House.
</p>

<p>
  A conservative Congress passed the <strong>Welfare Reform Bill</strong>, which
  made cuts to welfare programs.
</p>

<p>
  In 1995, the government shut down when Congress could not agree on a budget.
</p>
<p>
  In the <b>election of 1996</b>, Clinton beat Republican <u>Bob Dole</u>.&nbsp;
  <u> Ross Perot</u>, the third party candidate, again finished third.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clinton Again</strong></p>
<p>During his second term, Clinton was more of a political moderate.</p>
<p>
  The economy was booming in the late 1990s due to the Federal Reserve Board's
  low interest rates and the growth of Internet business.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The North American Free Trade Agreement </strong
  >(<strong>NAFTA</strong>) was passed in 1993, and it created a<strong>
    free-trade zone</strong
  >
  between Mexico, Canda, and the United States. (It eliminated tariffs between
  the countries).
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>World Trade Organization</strong> (<strong>WTO</strong>) was
  created in 1994, and it promoted trade between the participating countries. It
  was supported by Clinton.
</p>
<p>
  Clinton fought for two domestic issues during his second term: the fight
  against <strong>tobacco companies</strong> and the fight for<strong>
    gun control</strong
  >.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Problems Abroad</b>
</p>

<p>
  Clinton struggled to develop an American foreign policy that wasn't centered
  around fighting communism.
</p>
<p>
  Clinton sent troops to Somalia, but eventually withdrew them.&nbsp;Clinton
  initially criticized China for its human rights abuses, but he eventually
  supported China when he realized how important trade with China was to
  America.
</p>

<p>
  Clinton committed American troops to NATO to keep the peace in the former
  <b> Yugoslavia</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Clinton led the 1993 reconciliation meeting between Israel's
  <u> Yitzhak Rabin</u> and Palestinian <u>Yasir Arafat</u> at the White
  House.&nbsp; Two years later, though, Rabin was assassinated, ending hopes for
  peace in the Middle East.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scandal and Impeachment</strong></p>
<p>
  In 1998, it was discovered that President Clinton had an affair with a White
  House intern, Monica Lewinsky (<strong>Lewinsky Affair</strong>). Clinton lied
  about the affair under oath. The House Republicans passed two articles of
  <strong>impeachment</strong> against Clinton: perjury before a grand jury and
  obstruction of justice.
</p>
<p>
  In 1999, the Senate voted to remove Clinton from office, but the Republicans
  failed to obtain the 2/3 majority that was required.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clinton's Legacy</strong></p>
<p>
  The American economy prospered during Clinton's era in large part because of
  the global economic expansion.
</p>
<p>
  Just prior to leaving office, Clinton negotiated a deal to get immunity from
  possible legal action over the Lewinsky scandal.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Bush-Gore Presidential Battle</strong></p>
<p>
  The Democrats nominal <u>Albert Gore</u> for president and
  <u>Joseph Lieberman</u> for vice president for the<strong>
    election of 2000</strong
  >. The Republicans nominated <u>George W. Bush</u> for president and
  <u>Dick Cheney</u> for vice president. Bush won nomination in large part
  because he was the son of former president George H. W. Bush.
</p>
<p>
  Bush supported returning the federal budget surplus back to the people through
  tax cuts and through giving money to private institutions who would help the
  poor. Gore supported smaller tax cuts and strengthening Social Security.
</p>
<p>
  The election was very close and the electoral votes of
  <strong>Florida</strong> would decide who won. For five weeks, it was
  uncertain who won Florida's ballots, some of which were defective or
  unreadable. The Supreme Court eventually ruled (on party lines) that
  <strong>Bush had won the presidency</strong>. Although Bush won more electoral
  votes, <strong>Bush lost the popular vote</strong>. (More people voted for
  Gore than for Bush.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reelecting George W. Bush</strong></p>
<p>
  Bush wanted to be considered a "compassionate conservative." He supported tax
  cuts and a constitutional amendment for banning gay marriage.
</p>
<p>
  For the election of 2004, the Republicans re-nominated Bush and the Democrats
  selected <u>John F. Kerry</u>.
</p>
<p><strong>Bush won the election of 2004</strong>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Protestant Reformation Produces Puritanism</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  German friar <u>Martin Luther</u> denounced the authority of the priests and
  popes when he nailed his protests against Catholic doctrines to the door of
  Wittenberg's cathedral in <b>1517</b>.&nbsp; He declared that the Bible alone
  was the source of God's words.&nbsp; He started the "Protestant Reformation."
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>John Calvin</u> of Geneva elaborated Martin Luther's ideas.&nbsp; He wrote
  his basic doctrine in Latin in 1536, entitled
  <b><i>Institutes of the Christian Religion</i></b
  >.&nbsp; These ideas formed <b>Calvinism</b>. Calvanism supported the idea of
  <strong>predestination</strong>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  When King Henry VIII broke his ties with the Roman Catholic Church in the
  <b>1530s</b>, he formed the Protestant Church.&nbsp; There were a few people
  who wanted to see the process of taking Catholicism out of England occur more
  quickly.&nbsp; These people were called <b>Puritans</b>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  A tiny group<i> </i>of Puritans, called <b>Separatists</b>, broke away from
  the Church of England (Protestant).&nbsp; Fearing that his subjects would defy
  him both as their political leader and spiritual leader, King James I, the
  head of state of England and head of the church from <b>1603-1625</b>,<b
  > </b>threatened to kick the Separatists out of England.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Pilgrims End Their Pilgrimage at Plymouth</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Losing their identity as English, a group of Separatists in Holland came to
  America in search for religious freedom.&nbsp; The group settled outside the
  domain of the Virginia Company and, without legal permission, settled in
  <b> Plymouth Bay </b>in <b>1620</b>.

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Before disembarking from the Mayflower, the Pilgrim leaders drew up and signed
  the <b>Mayflower Compact</b>.&nbsp; This was a simple agreement to form a
  crude government and to submit to the will of the majority under the
  regulations agreed upon.&nbsp; It was signed by 41 adult males.&nbsp; It was
  the <b>first attempt at a government in America.</b>

  In <b>1629</b>, an energetic group of non-Separatist Puritans, fearing for
  their faith and for England's future, secured a royal charter to form the
  <b>Massachusetts Bay Company</b>.&nbsp; (Massachusetts Bay Colony)&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  During the <b>Great Migration</b> of the 1630s, about 70,000 refugees left

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Building the Bay Colony</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Massachusetts Bay Colony was not a democracy because its governor
  (Winthrop) did not like Democracy. He did not think that the "commoners" could
  rule.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Seeds of Colonial Unity and Independence</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1643</b>, 4 colonies banded together to form the
  <b> New England Confederation</b>.&nbsp; It was made to defend against foes or
  potential foes.&nbsp; The confederation consisted of only Puritan colonies -
  two Massachusetts colonies (the <b>Bay Colony </b>and small <b>Plymouth</b>)
  and two Connecticut colonies (<b>New Haven </b>and the scattered valley
  settlements).
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Each colony had 2 votes, regardless of size.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  As a slap at the Massachusetts Bay Colony, King Charles II gave rival
  Connecticut in <b>1662 </b>a sea-to-sea charter grant, which legalized the
  squatter settlements.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1663</b>, the outcasts in Rhode Island received a new charter, which
  gave kingly sanction to the most religiously tolerant government yet devised
  in America.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1684</b>, the Massachusetts Bay Colony's charter was revoked by London
  authorities.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Andros Promotes the First American Revolution</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1686</b>, the <b>Dominion of New England </b>was created by royal
  authority.&nbsp; Unlike the homegrown New England Confederation, it was
  imposed from London.&nbsp; It embraced all of New England until in
  <b>1688 </b> when it was <b>expanded</b> to New York and East and West Jersey.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <b>leader</b> of the Dominion of New England was
  <u>Sir Edmund Andros</u> - an able English military man.&nbsp; He established
  headquarters in <b>Puritanical Boston</b>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Andros stopped the town meetings; laid heavy restrictions on the courts, the
  press, and schools; and revoked all land titles.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1688-1689</b>, the people of old England engineered the<b> Glorious </b
  >(or <b>Bloodless</b>) <b>Revolution</b>.&nbsp; They dethroned Catholic James
  II and enthroned the Protestant rulers of the Netherlands, the Dutch-born
  <u>William III</u> and his English wife, <u>Mary</u>, daughter of James II.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In <b>1691</b>, Massachusetts was made a royal colony.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  There was <b>unrest </b>in New York and Maryland from <b> 1689-1691</b>, until
  newly appointed royal governors restored a semblance of order.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Old Netherlands at New Netherland</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Late in the <b>16<sup>th</sup> Century</b>, the <b> Netherlands</b> fought for
  and won its <b>independence from Catholic Spain</b> with the help of England.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In the 17<sup>th</sup> Century, the Dutch (the Netherlands) became a
  power.&nbsp; <b>Golden Age.</b>&nbsp; It fought
  <b>3 great Anglo-Dutch naval battles</b>.&nbsp; The Dutch Republic became a
  leading colonial power, with by far its greatest activity in the East
  Indies.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <b>Dutch East India Company </b>was nearly a state within a state and at
  one time supported an army of 10,000 men and a fleet of 190 ships, 40 of them
  men-of-war.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  This company hired an English explorer, <u>Henry Hudson</u>, to seek great
  riches.&nbsp; He sailed into the Delaware Bay and New York Bay in
  <b> 1609</b> and then ascended the Hudson River.&nbsp; He filed a Dutch claim
  to a wooded and watered area.&nbsp; The <b>Dutch West India Company </b>was
  less powerful than the Dutch East India Company, and was based in the
  Caribbean.&nbsp; It was more interested in raiding than trading.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1628</b>, in raided a fleet of Spanish treasure ships and stole $15
  million.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The company established outposts in Africa and Brazil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1623-1624</b>, the Dutch West India Company established
  <u>New Netherland</u> in the Hudson River area.&nbsp; It was made for its
  quick-profit fur trade.&nbsp; The company also purchased
  <u>Manhattan Island</u> from the Indians for worthless trinkets. The island
  encompassed 22,000 acres.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>New Amsterdam</b>, later New York City, was a<b> company town</b>.&nbsp;
  The Quakers were savagely abused.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Friction with English and Swedish Neighbors</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  New England was hostile to the growth of its Dutch neighbor, and the people of
  Connecticut finally ejected intruding Hollanders from their verdant
  valley.&nbsp; 3 of the 4 member colonies of the New England Confederation were
  eager to wipe out New Netherland with military force.&nbsp; Massachusetts,
  providing most of the troops, rejected this.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  From <b>1638-1655</b>, the Swedish trespassed on Dutch preserves by planting
  the anemic colony of<b> New Sweden </b>on the Delaware River.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <b>Golden Age </b>for Sweden was during and following the
  <b>Thirty Years' War of 1618-1648</b>, in which its brilliant
  <u>King Gustavus Adolphus</u> had carried the torch for Protestantism.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Resenting the Swedish intrusion, the Dutch dispatched a small military
  expedition in <b>1655</b>.&nbsp; It was led by the able of the
  directors-general, <u>Peter Stuyvesant</u>, who had lost a leg while
  soldiering in the West Indies and was dubbed "Father Wooden Leg" by the
  Indians.&nbsp; The main fort fell after a bloodless siege, whereupon Swedish
  rule came to an abrupt end.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dutch Residues in New York</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1664</b>, the Dutch were forced to surrender their territory (New
  Netherland) to the English when a strong English squadron appeared off the
  coast of New Amsterdam.&nbsp; <b>New Amsterdam was named New York</b>, after
  the Duke of York.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Penn's Holy Experiment in Pennsylvania</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  A group of dissenters, commonly known as <b>Quakers,</b> arose in England in
  the <b>mid-1600s</b>.&nbsp; Officially, they were known as the Religious
  Society of Friends.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Quakers were especially offensive to the authorities, both religious and
  civil.&nbsp; They refused to support the Church of England with taxes.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>William Penn</u> was attracted to the Quaker faith in 1660.&nbsp; In
  <b>1681</b>, he managed to secure from King Charles II an immense grant of
  fertile land, in consideration of a monetary debt owed to his deceased father
  by the crown.&nbsp; The king called the area <b>Pennsylvania</b>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Quaker Pennsylvania and Its Neighbors</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Quakers treated the Indians very well.&nbsp; Many immigrants came to
  Pennsylvania seeking <b>religious freedom</b>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  "<strong>Blue Laws</strong>" prevented "ungodly revelers" from staging plays,
  playing cards, dice, games, and excessive hilarity.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  By <b>1700,</b> Pennsylvania surpassed all but Massachusetts and Virginia as
  the most populous and wealthy colony.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  William Penn was never fully liked by his colonists because of his friendly
  relations with James II.&nbsp; He was arrested for treason thrice and thrown
  into prison.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1664</b>, New Netherland, a territory along the Hudson River, was taken
  by the English and granted to <u>Lord John Berkeley</u> and
  <u>Sir George Carteret</u>. This grant that was given to Carteret and Berkeley
  divided the region into East and West New Jersey, respectively.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Berkeley sold West New Jersey in <b>1674</b> to a William Penn and his group
  of Quakers, who set up a sanctuary before Pennsylvania was launched.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1681</b> (the same year that Penn was given the region of Pennsylvania
  from King Charles II), William Penn and his Quakers purchased East New Jersey
  from Carteret's widow.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1702</b>, the proprieters of East and West New Jersey voluntarily
  surrendered their governmental powers over the region to the royal crown after
  confusion began to arise over the large number of landowners and growing
  resentment of authority. England combined the two territories (East and West
  New Jersey) into <b>one colony</b> in <b>1702</b>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Middle Way in the Middle Colonies</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The middle colonies New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, were
  known as the <b>"bread colonies" </b>because of their heavy exports of
  <b>grain</b>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  These colonies were more ethnically mixed than any of the other
  colonies.&nbsp; The people were given more religious tolerance than in any
  other colonies.

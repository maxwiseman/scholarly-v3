<h3>Chapter 27</h3>
<h4>Empire and Expansion</h4>
<h4>1890-1909</h4>
<hr />
<p><strong>America Turns Outward</strong></p>
<p>
  Americans felt that expansion to overseas markets might provide relief to the
  labor violence and agrarian unrest that existed in the country. Americans also
  felt emboldened with a new sense of power generated by the growth in
  population, wealth, and productive capacity.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Reverend Josiah Strong's</u>
  <i>Our Country:&nbsp; Its Possible Future and Its Present Crisis</i> inspired
  missionaries to travel to foreign nations.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan's</u> book of 1890, The
  <u> Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660-1783</u>, argued that control of
  the sea was the key to world dominance; it stimulated the naval race among the
  great powers.
</p>
<p>
  Secretary of state, <u>James G. Blaine</u> published his
  <strong>"Big Sister" policy</strong> tried to get the Latin American countries
  to open their markets to Americans.
</p>
<p>
  Americans were prepared to go to war over many small disputes with other
  countries. This demonstrated the country's new aggressive mood.
</p>

<p>
  The area between British Guiana and Venezuela had been in dispute for over 50
  years.&nbsp; Conflict between the British and Venezuela arose when gold was
  discovered in the contested area.
</p>
<p>
  Secretary of state, <u>Richard Olney</u>, warned that if Britain went to war
  with <strong>Venezuela</strong>, then Britain would be violating the
  <strong>Monroe Doctrine</strong>. When Britain disregarded this warning,
  President Cleveland threatended war.
</p>
<p>
  Britain was pre-occupied with other potential wars in Europe, so they chose to
  avoid a new war and reconcile with the United States.&nbsp;The
  <strong>Great Rapprochement</strong>, or reconciliation, between the United
  States and Britain became a cornerstone of both nations' foreign policies.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Spurning the Hawaiian Pear</b></p>
<p>The first New England missionaries reached <b>Hawaii</b> in <b>1820</b>.</p>
<p>
  Beginning in the 1840s, the State Department warned other countries to stay
  out of Hawaii.&nbsp; In <strong>1887</strong>, a treaty with the native
  government guaranteed <strong>naval-base rights</strong> at Pearl Harbor.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sugar imports</strong> from Hawaii became less profitable with the
  <strong>McKinley Tariff of 1890</strong>.&nbsp; American planters decided that
  the best way to overcome the tariff would be to annex Hawaii.
  <u>Queen Liliuokalani</u> insisted that native Hawaiian should control the
  islands.
</p>
<p>
  In 1893, Americans successfully overthrew the Queen. Most Hawaiians did not
  want to be annexed, though, so <u>President Grover Cleveland</u> decided to
  delay annexation of Hawaii.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Cubans Rise in Revolt</b></p>
<p>
  Cubans revolted against Spanish rule in 1895. &nbsp;Cuban
  <strong>insurrectos</strong> burned sugar canefields believing that if they
  destroyed enough of Cuba, then Spain might abandon Cuba or the United States
  might move in and help the Cubans with their independence.&nbsp;The Spanish
  put Cubans in <strong>reconstruction camps</strong> so they could not support
  the insurrectos.
</p>
<p>America had a large investment and conducted substantial trade with Cuba.</p>
<p>
  Congress passed a resolution in <strong>1896</strong> that recognized the
  revolting Cubans.&nbsp; President Cleveland opposed imperialism and he said
  that he would not go to war with Spain over Cuba.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>The Mystery of the </b><i><b>Maine</b></i
  ><b> Explosion</b>
</p>
<p>
  <u>William R. Hearst </u>and <u>Joseph Pulitzer</u> used "<strong
    >yellow journalism</strong
  >" to inflate the anger of the American people over the crisis in Cuba.
</p>
<p>
  On <strong>February 15, 1898</strong>, the American ship,
  <strong><em>Maine</em></strong> blew up in the Havana port.&nbsp; The Spanish
  claimed it was an accident (spontaneous combustion in one of the coal
  bunkers), while the Americans claimed that Spain had sunk it.&nbsp; The
  American people did not believe the Spanish, and war with Spain became
  imminent.
</p>

<p>
  Spain had agreed to the Americans' 2 basic demands: an end to the
  reconstruction camps and an armistice with Cuban rebels.
</p>
<p>
  Although President McKinley did not want a war with Spain, the American people
  did.&nbsp; He conceded to the American people, and he sent his war message to
  Congress on <strong>April 11, 1898</strong>.&nbsp; Congress declared war and
  adopted the <strong>Teller Amendment</strong>.&nbsp; It said that
  <em>when</em> the United States had beaten the Spanish, the Cubans would be
  free.

<p><b>Dewey's May Day Victory at Manila</b></p>
<p>
  The Spanish military significantly outnumbered the American army, but American
  naval ships were in much better condition than the Spanish.
</p>
<p>
  Commodore <u>George Dewey's</u> 6-ship fleet attacked Spain's
  <strong>Philippines </strong>on <strong>May 1, 1898</strong>. Dewey
  <strong>attacked</strong> <strong> and</strong> <strong>destroyed</strong> the
  10-ship Spanish fleet at <strong>Manila</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  German ships threatened to attack Dewey's ships in the Manila harbor (claiming
  that they wanted to protect German nationals). After several incidents, the
  potential for conflict with Germany blew over.
</p>
<p>On <b>August 13, 1898</b>, American troops captured Manila.</p>
<p>
  With the victory in the Philippines, it was thought that Hawaii was needed as
  a supply base for Dewey.&nbsp; Therefore, Congress passed a joint resolution
  of Congress to <strong>annex Hawaii</strong> on <strong>July 7, 1898</strong>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Confused Invasion of Cuba</b></p>
<p>
  Shortly after the outbreak of the war, the Spanish government sent a fleet of
  warships to Cuba, led by <u>Admiral Cervera</u>.&nbsp; He was blockaded in the
  Santiago harbor in Cuba by American ships.
</p>
<p>
  The "<strong>Rough Riders</strong>," was a regiment of American volunteers
  that was commanded by Colonel <u>Leonard Wood</u> and organized by
  <u>Theodore Roosevelt</u>.
</p>

<p>
  The advancing American army caused the Spanish fleet to retreat from the
  Santiago harbor. Admiral Cervera's fleet was entirely destroyed on
  <strong>July 3, 1898.</strong> General <u>Nelson A. Miles</u> met little
  resistance when he took over<strong> Puerto Rico</strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>On <b>August 12, 1898</b>, Spain signed an armistice.</p>
<p>
  Many more Americans had been killed by malaria, typhoid, and yellow fever than
  by bullets.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>America's Course (Curse?) of Empire</strong></p>
<p>
  Spanish and Americans met in Paris in 1898 to discuss terms to the end of the
  war.&nbsp; The Americans secured <strong>Guam</strong> and
  <strong> Puerto Rico</strong>, but the <strong>Philippines</strong> presented
  President McKinley with a problem:&nbsp; he didn't want to give the island
  back to the Spanish, but he also didn't want to leave the island in a state of
  disarray.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  McKinley finally decided to Christianize all of the Filipinos. Because Manila
  had been captured the day after the war, America agreed to pay Spain
  <strong>$20 million</strong> for the Philippines.
</p>
<p>
  The treaty was controversial, especially in regards to the acquisition of the
  Philippines. The <strong>Anti-Imperialistic League </strong>fought McKinley's
  expansionist moves, in regards to the Philippines.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>expansionists</strong> argued that Americans have a duty to help
  the underprivileged people of the world.
</p>
<p>
  The Senate <strong>approved</strong> the treaty on
  <strong>February 6, 1899</strong>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Perplexities in Puerto Rico and Cuba</b></p>
<p>
  The <strong>Foraker Act of 1900</strong> gave the Puerto Ricans a limited
  degree of popular government. In 1917, they were granted U.S. citizenship.
</p>
<p>
  The Supreme Court's rulings in the
  <strong><em>Insular Cases</em></strong> declared that the Constitution did not
  extend to the Philippines and Puerto Rico.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The United States, honoring the Teller Amendment of 1898, withdrew from Cuba
  in <strong>1902</strong>.&nbsp; The U.S. forced the Cubans to write their own
  constitution of 1901 (the <strong>Platt Amendment</strong>). The Cubans hated
  this document because it was written to benefit the Americans. The
  constitution decreed that the United States might intervene with troops in
  Cuba to restore order and to provide mutual protection.&nbsp; The Cubans also
  promised to sell or lease needed coaling or naval stations to the U.S.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>New Horizons in Two Hemispheres</b></p>
<p>
  Although the Spanish-American War only lasted 113 days, it increased American
  prestige around the world.
</p>
<p>
  One of the greatest results of the war was the
  <strong>bonding between the North and the South</strong>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"Little Brown Brothers" in the Philippines</strong></p>
<p>
  The Filipinos thought that the treaty would give them their independence, like
  the Cubans. This was not the case and on February 4, 1899, the Filipinos
  started a rebellion against the occupying American forces.&nbsp; The
  insurrection was led by <u> Emilio Aguinaldo</u>.
</p>
<p>
  In <strong> 1901</strong>, American soldiers captured the rebellion's leader,
  Emilio Aguinaldo, effectively ending the rebellion.
</p>
<p>
  President McKinley appointed the <strong>Philippine Commission</strong> in
  <strong>1899</strong> to set up a Filipino government.&nbsp;
  <u>William H. Taft</u> led the body.&nbsp; He genuinely liked the Filipinos,
  while the American soldiers did not.
</p>
<p>
  President McKinley's plan of "<strong>benevolent assimilation</strong>" of the
  Filipinos was very slow and it involved improving roads, sanitation, and
  public health.&nbsp; The plan developed economic ties and set up a school
  system with English as the 2<sup>nd</sup> language.&nbsp;This system was hated
  by the Filipinos who preferred liberty over assimilation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Hinging the Open Door in China</b></p>
<p>
  Following China's defeat by Japan in 1894-1895, several European powers move
  into <strong>China</strong>. Secretary of State <u>John Hay</u> released the
  <strong>Open Door</strong> note, which urged foreign powers to respect Chinese
  commercial rights.&nbsp; <strong>Russia</strong> was the only major power to
  not accept it.
</p>
<p>
  In <strong>1900</strong>, Chinese group known as the
  <strong>"Boxers"</strong> killed hundreds of foreigners in the
  <strong>Boxer Rebellion</strong>.&nbsp; A multinational rescue force came in
  and stopped the rebellion.
</p>
<p>
  After the failed rebellion, Secretary Hay declared in
  <strong> 1900</strong> that the Open Door would include the respect of Chinese
  territory, in addition to its commercial integrity.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Imperialism or Bryanism in 1900?</b></p>
<p>
  <u>President McKinley</u> was the Republican presidential nominee for the
  <strong>election of 1900</strong> because he had led the country through a
  war, acquired rich real estate, established the gold standard, and brought
  prosperity to the nation.&nbsp; McKinley and the Republican Party supported
  the gold standard and imperialism.
</p>
<p><u>Theodore Roosevelt</u> was nominated as the vice president.</p>
<p>
  <u>William Jennings Bryan</u> was the Democratic presidential candidate for
  the election.&nbsp; Bryan and the Democratic Party supported the silver
  standard and anti-imperialism.&nbsp; They proclaimed that the paramount
  election issue was Republican overseas imperialism. The Republican party
  proclaimed that Bryan would destroy the nation's prosperity once he took
  office with his free-silver policy and other "dangerous" ideas.
</p>
<p>McKinley and the Republican Party won the election of 1900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>TR:&nbsp; Brandisher of the Big Stick</b></p>
<p>
  In September <strong>1901</strong>, President McKinley was
  <strong>assassinated</strong>. <u>Theodore Roosevelt</u> took over the
  presidency.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Roosevelt felt that the president should lead, boldly. He had no real respect
  for the checks and balances system among the 3 branches of government.&nbsp;
  He felt that he may take any action in the general interest of the public that
  is not specifically forbidden by the Constitution.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building the Panama Canal</strong></p>
<p>
  The Americans wanted to build a canal through the Central American isthmus to
  allow ships to quickly cross from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.
  Because of friendly relations with Britain, Britain signed the
  <strong> Hay-Pauncefote Treaty</strong> in <strong>1901</strong>, which
  allowed the U.S. to build and fortify the canal.
</p>
<p>
  Congress decided to build the canal through Panama. An offer to buy land for
  the canal had been <strong>rejected by the Colombian senate</strong>, who
  thought the U.S. monetary offer was too low.
</p>
<p>
  The Panamanians feared the U.S. would choose the Nicaraguan route for the
  canal; Panama would miss out on a prosperity created by the canal's
  construction. So, on November 3, 1903, Panamanians successfully revolted
  against Columbian rule. The revolt was led by <u>Bunau-Varilla</u>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Bunau-Varilla became the Panamanian minister to the United States and signed
  the <strong>Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty</strong> in Washington.&nbsp; The treaty
  gave the U.S. control of a 10-mile zone around the proposed Panama Canal.
</p>

<p>
  The involvement in Panama marked a downward lurch in U.S. &nbsp;relations with
  Latin America.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  In <strong>1904</strong> the construction of the
  <strong>Panama Canal</strong> began, and it was completed in
  <strong>1914</strong> at a cost of $400 million.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>TR's Perversion of Monroe's Doctrine</b></p>
<p>
  Several Latin American countries were in debt to European countries.
  &nbsp;Roosevelt feared that this would allow for future European involvement
  in Latin America, so he created a policy known as "<strong
    >preventive intervention</strong
  >."&nbsp; The <strong>Roosevelt Corollary</strong> to the Monroe Doctrine
  declared that the U.S. could pay off the Latin American counties' debts to
  keep European nations out of Latin America.
</p>
<p>
  Latin American countries hated the Monroe Doctrine because it had become the
  excuse for numerous U.S. interventions in Latin America.&nbsp; In actuality,
  President Roosevelt was the one to blame for the interventions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Roosevelt on the World Stage</b></p>
<p>
  <strong>Japan</strong> went to <strong>war</strong> with
  <strong>Russia</strong> in <strong>1904</strong> after Russia failed to
  withdraw troops from Manchuria and Korea. Roosevelt brokered a peace agreement
  in 1905 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The Japanese received no compensation
  for their losses and the southern half of Sakhalin.
</p>
<p>
  Because of the treaty, friendship with Russia waned and Japan became a rival
  with America in Asia.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Japanese Laborers in California</b></p>
<p>
  Thousands of Japanese were recruited to work in California after the Japanese
  government lifted its emigration ban in 1884. &nbsp;Japanese immigrants were
  confronted with racist hostility by whites.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1906</b>, San Francisco's school board segregated the Chinese, Japanese,
  and Korean students to make room for white students.&nbsp; The Japanese saw
  this action as an insult and threatened with war.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  President Roosevelt stepped in and persuaded the Californians to repeal the
  segregation. The Japanese agreed to stop the flow of immigrants to the United
  States. This agreement was known as the "<strong>Gentlemen's Agreement</strong
  >."
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1908</b>, the <b>Root-Takahira agreement</b> was reached with
  Japan.&nbsp; The U.S. and Japan pledged themselves to respect each other's
  territorial possessions.&nbsp;

	  <p>Chapter 42</p>
<p>The American People Face a New Century</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Economic Revolutions</b></p>
      
<p> The "<b>information age</b>" followed World War 
  II and was marked by an industry of storing, organizing, and processing data. 
</p>
<p>New communication tools threatened to eliminate jobs including 
  post office workers, store clerks, and teachers.</p>
<p> Scientific advancements created social and moral questions 
  like, “Should the human gene pool be engineered?”</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><b>Affluence and Inequality</b></p>
<p> Although Americans’ salaries increased during the 
  1990's and 2000's, they did not have the world's high per-capita income, like 
  they had in the 25 years after WWII. From the 1990s-2000s, the <b>economic disparity 
  between the rich and the poor</b> increased as the richest 20 percent of Americans 
  made half of the nation’s income. This was caused by: </p>
      
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Decrease in number of high-paying 
  manufacturing jobs for skilled workers</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Higher pay for educated workers in 
  high-tech industry</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Decline of unions</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Growth of part-time work</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Increase in number of immigrants</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; • Increasing tendency for highly paid 
  men and women to marry and pool their income</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><b>The Feminist Revolution</b></p>
<p> Half of all workers were women by the 1990s. Women began 
  to enter male-dominated fields including airline pilots, lawyers, etc. Despite 
  these gains, women still made less money than men in equivalent positions, and 
  women were still minorities in traditionally male-dominated fields. The <b>gender 
  gap</b> was caused by discrimination and the greater burdens that families placed 
  on women.</p>
<p> In <b>1993</b>, Congress passed a <b>Family Leave Bill</b> 
  to provide<b> job protection</b> for working fathers and mothers who needed 
  to take time off work for their family.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><b>New Families and Old</b></p>
<p> 50 percent of marriages ended in <b>divorce</b> during the 
  1990s.</p>
<p> The relative number of adults living alone tripled by the 
  1990s.</p>
<p> By the 1990s, 1/4 children grew up in a household without 
  two parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><b>The Aging of America</b></p>
<p> The <b>lifespan</b> of Americans <b>increased</b> by the 
  1990s due in large part to <b>advances in medicine</b>; males and females had 
  life expectancies of 76 and 83, respectively. </p>
<p> Because of the increased lifespan, the relative number of 
  old people increased. Consequently, the percentage of the GNP spent on <b>healthcare</b> 
  for older people doubled after the creation of <b>Medicare</b> in <b>1965</b>. 
</p>
<p> The <b>Social Security system was strained</b> because the 
  ratio of active workers (contributors) to retirees (benefactors) had decreased 
  dramatically (i.e. more money was being taken out than was being put in). These 
  fiscal problems were compounded when Medicare was made available to the elderly. 
  These problems led to<b> increased taxes</b> on workers. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><b>The New Immigration</b></p>
<p> Immigration from <b>Asia</b> and<b> Latin America </b>increased 
  rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s. Immigrants came to America in search of 
  jobs and opportunity, leaving countries where populations were growing rapidly.</p>
<p> The<b> Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 </b>made 
  it illegal for employers to hire undocumented immigrants, and it granted amnesty 
  to many illegal immigrants already in the U.S.</p>
<p> Anti-immigration sentiment swept over America as people 
  were concerned that the U.S. could not absorb the influx of immigrants. Studies 
  showed that immigrants actually took jobs that Americans didn't want. Immigrants 
  also paid more dollars in taxes than they received in welfare.</p>
<p>In the late 2000's, <strong>anti-immigrant sentiment </strong>swept 
  over the country. In 2010, Arizona passed a law that required police officers 
  to detain people if there was a "reasonable suspicion" that they were 
  not legally in the country. Also in 2010, Congress rejected the<strong> DREAM 
  Act</strong>, which would have given a path to citizenship for undocumented 
  young people who had finished college or served in the U.S. military.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><b>Beyond the Melting Pot</b></p>
<p> <b>Hispanic-Americans</b> were becoming a larger minority 
  in the U.S. during the 1990s and 2000s. They were also becoming more politically 
  organized. <u>Cesar Chavez</u>, head of the <b>United Farm Workers Organization 
  Committee</b>, improved working conditions for Mexican-American field laborers 
  of the American West. Hispanics were elected as mayors of several large cities.</p>
<p> By the 1980s, <b>Asian-Americans</b> were the<b> fastest-growing 
  minority.</b> They were becoming <b>more prosperous</b> than many Americans, 
  earning 20 percent more than the typical white household. </p>
<p> Native Americans continued to experience discrimination 
  and poverty, even as tribes opened casinos on their reservations to white patrons.</p>

	  <p><b>Cities and Suburbs</b></p>
<p> <b>Violent crime rates</b> exploded during the 1980s, hitting 
  an all-time high during this decade. Crime leveled off in the 1990s, but this 
  trend had caused middle income Americans to<b> flee the cities for the suburbs</b>. 
  By the 1990s, a majority of Americans lived in the suburbs. </p>
<p> By the 2000s, some major cities started to rebound as commercial 
  redevelopment increased in cities.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><b>Minority America</b></p>
<p> Problems in cities were compounded by racial and ethnic 
  tensions. In <b>1992</b>, a mostly white jury acquitted several white police 
  officers who were videotaped beating <u>Rodney King</u>. The acquittals sparked 
  <b>riots</b> by many angry African-Americans in <b>Los Angeles</b>.</p>
<p> In <b>1995</b>, <u>OJ Simpson</u> was found not guilty of 
  killing his former wife and another victim. African-Americans felt that the 
  verdict was just, while white Americans believed that Simpson was guilty.</p>
<p> By the 1990s, <b>cities</b> were comprised mostly of<b> 
  lower-income minorities</b>, as whites had fled to the suburbs. As a consequence 
  of this, cities did not have the tax revenue to support school and small businesses. 
  Cities fell into disrepair and were plagued by drug addiction and a lack of 
  hope and resources.</p>
<p> By the 1990s, about 40 percent of African-Americans were 
  in the middle class. More African-American politicians were being elected at 
  local, state, and federal levels.</p>
<p> Half of black families were headed by a <b>single mother</b>. 
  Social scientists argued that limited support at home led to poor academic performance. 
  Black children had about one year less of education than whites during the 1990s, 
  and blacks were 50 percent less likely to get a college degree. </p>
<p>In 2003, the Supreme Court <strong>upheld affirmative action</strong> 
  by ruling that the University of Michigan could use race as a factor in the 
  admissions process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>E Pluribus Plures</strong></p>
<p>In the late 20th century, Americans began to stress the need 
  to preserve and promote ethnic and racial cultures. As racial barriers were 
  broken down, Americans were becoming more interracial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><b>The Postmodern Mind</b></p>
<p> More Americans were receiving <b>college degrees</b>, and 
  this expanding population of educated people <b>increased interest in liberal 
  arts </b>(reading, museums, music, etc). The American West became a popular 
  literary focal point as more Americans moved west. Authors including Larry McMurtry, 
  Raymond Carver, and Annie Dillard wrote Western-themed novels. </p>
<p> The number of popular <b>authors</b> and <b>artists</b> 
  who were <b>minorities</b> (African-American, Asian-American, and women) also 
  increased.</p>
<p> <b>New York</b> became the <b>art capital of the world </b>after 
  World War II. The Ford Foundation and the federal government (<b>National Endowment 
  for the Arts </b>in<b> 1965</b>) supported the arts.</p>
<p> Notable <b>artists</b> after WWII included Jackson Pollock, 
  Willem de Kooning, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, and Georgia O’Keeffe. 
  <b>Film</b> continued to grow as generations of younger filmmakers emerged (George 
  Lucas, Spike Lee, Steven Spielberg, etc). Interest in <b>architecture</b> also 
  increased after WWII due to the building boom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The New Media</strong></p>
<p>By 2009, 70% of American households had Internet access.</p>
<p>The Internet had a democratizing effect, allowing people 
  all over the world to rapidly share information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The American Prospect</b></p>
<p>Solar cells, wind turbines, and electric cars took hold in 
  the early 21st century.</p>
<p>The September 11th attacks initiated America's war on terrorism. 
  This war helped to isolate it from the rest of the world. American citizens' 
  liberties were threatened by America's increasing interest in protecting its 
  borders.</p>

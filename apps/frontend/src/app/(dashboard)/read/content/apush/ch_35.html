<h3>Chapter 35</h3>
<h4>America in World War II</h4>
<h4>1941-1945</h4>
<hr />
<p>
  Prior to the bombing at Pearl Harbor, the U.S. had agreed to the
  <strong>ABC-1 agreement </strong>with the British. It stated that if the U.S.
  entered the war, then it would focus its efforts <em>first</em> on Germany.
  After Germany was defeated, the Allies would focus on Japan.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Allies Trade Space for Time</b></p>
<p>
  For the U.S., WWII was far more complex than WWI. It had to feed, clothe, and
  transport its forces all over the world.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Shock of War</b></p>
<p>
  National unity during World War II sped up the assimilation of immigrants into
  American society.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike in WWI, there was <b>almost</b> no government witch-hunting of minority
  groups in WWII. The exception to this was when 110,000
  <b> Japanese-Americans</b> on the Pacific Coast forced into
  <b> concentration camps</b>. This was authorized by
  <strong>Executive Order No. 9066</strong>. Washington feared that they might
  act as saboteurs for Japan in case of invasion.
</p>
<p>
  The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the concentration camps in
  <b><i>Korematsu</i> v. </b><i><b>U.S</b></i
  ><b>. </b> (<b>1944</b>).
</p>
<p>
  The conservative Congress cancelled many of the New Deal programs. President
  Roosevelt declared in <b>1943</b> that the New Deal reform era was over.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Building the War Machine</b></p>
<p>
  The Great Depression was completely ended with the inrush of military orders.
  Under the <b>War Production Board</b> <b> (WPB)</b>, which oversaw U.S. war
  production, American factories produced an enormous amount of weaponry, such
  as guns and planes. The WPB stopped the manufacture of nonessential items,
  such as passenger cars.
</p>
<p>
  The government imposed a national speed limit and gasoline rationing after
  America's supply of natural <b>rubber</b> from British Malaysia and the Dutch
  East Indies was broken.
</p>
<p>
  A scarcity of consumer goods led to sharp <strong>inflation</strong> in
  <strong>1942</strong>. The <b> Office of Price Administration</b> (<b>OPA</b>)
  eventually brought the down prices and curbed inflation.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>War Labor Board</b> (<b>WLB</b>) imposed ceilings on wage
  increases.&nbsp; Unhappy with the wage ceilings, some labor unions called
  their members to go on strike. In June 1943, Congress passed the
  <b>Smith-Connally Anti-Strike Act</b>. &nbsp;It authorized the federal
  government to operate industries that were under strike, like coal mines and
  railroads.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Manpower and Womanpower</b></p>
<p>
  Even with some industrial and agricultural workers being exempt from the
  draft, the draft left the nation's farms and factories short of personnel. In
  <b>1942</b>, thousands of Mexican agricultural workers, called
  <b><i>braceros</i></b
  >, were brought to America to harvest the farms of the West.
</p>
<p>
  The armed services enlisted nearly 216,000 <b>women</b> in WWII. Best known
  were the <b>WAACs</b> (army), <b>WAVES</b> (navy), and <b>SPARs</b> (Coast
  Guard).&nbsp; Although millions of women took jobs in factories, most women
  continued in their traditional household roles.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Wartime Migrations</b></p>
<p>
  The war caused Americans to move about the country. Many blacks left the South
  to work in the North, and this led to racial tensions in the North. In
  response to demands for equal opportunities for blacks, Roosevelt created the
  <b>Fair Employment Practices Commission</b> (<b>FEPC</b>) to monitor
  compliance with his executive order that forbade discrimination in defense
  industries.
</p>
<p>
  During WWII, FDR gave the South a disproportionate share of defense contracts
  to help it become more economically developed.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1944</b>, the invention of the <b>mechanical cotton picker</b> made the
  Cotton South's need for cheap labor disappear.&nbsp;As a result of this,
  millions of blacks moved north.
</p>
<p>
  Thousands of <b>Native Americans</b> served in the armed forces.&nbsp;
  Comanches in Europe and Navajos in the Pacific made valuable contributions as
  "<b>code talkers</b>," in which they transmitted radio messages in their
  native languages (incomprehensible to the Axis powers).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Holding the Home Front</b></p>
<p>
  America was not as ill-affected by the war as the rest of the world. The war
  substantially helped the American economy, and by the end of the war, the
  nation's GNP and citizens' disposable incomes had significantly risen.
</p>
<p>
  The Federal government became much more involved in individual citizens' lives
  during WWII, and this set the stage for the future role of government.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>national</b> <b>debt</b> rose from $49 billion to $259 billion from
  1941-1945.&nbsp; Most of the war costs were borrowed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Rising Sun in the Pacific</b></p>
<p>
  Simultaneously with the assault on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese launched attacks
  on various Far Eastern strongholds, including the American outposts of
  <b>Guam</b>, <b>Wake</b>, and the Philippines.
</p>
<p>
  In the <b>Philippines</b>, American forces, led by <u> General MacArthur</u>,
  held out against the invading Japanese force for 5 months. The America troops
  eventually surrendered on <b>April 9, 1942</b>.&nbsp; They were treated with
  vicious cruelty in the 80-mile Bataan Death March to prisoner-of-war
  camps.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The island fortress of <b>Corregidor</b> held out until it surrendered on
  <b>May 6, 1942</b>, giving the Japanese complete control of the Philippines.

<p><b>Japan's High Tide at Midway</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>May</b> <b>1942</b>, a crucial naval battle was fought in the
  <b>Coral Sea</b> between an American carrier task force, with Australian
  support, and a Japanese carrier task force. Although it suffered losses, the
  U.S. stopped the Japanese advancement. This was the first battle in which all
  the fighting was done by carrier-based aircraft.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>June 3-6</b>, <b>1942</b>, a naval battle was fought near
  <b>Midway</b>.&nbsp;If the Japanese took Midway, they would be able to
  directly launch attacks against Pearl Harbor.
  <u>Admiral Chester W. Nimitz</u> directed a smaller carrier force, under
  <u>Admiral Raymond A. Spruance,</u> against the powerful invading Japanese
  fleet. The Japanese retreated after losing 4 carriers.&nbsp; Midway was a
  <b>turning point</b> in the Pacific war.&nbsp; Combined with the Battle of
  Coral Sea, the U.S. success at Midway halted the Japanese.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>American Leapfrogging Toward Tokyo</b></p>
<p>
  From August 1942 to February 1943, Americans fought for control of
  <b> Guadalcanal Island</b> in an attempt to protect the shipping lanes from
  America to Australia through the Southwest Pacific. The Japanese troops
  evacuated Guadalcanal in <b>February 1943</b>. The casualty ratio was more
  than 10:1 (Japanese:American).
</p>
<p>
  The U.S. Navy "<b>leapfrogged</b>" several Japanese-held islands in the
  Pacific. Japanese soldiers were known to fight until every last man was dead.
  So, rather than fighting for every island, the strategy was to take nearby
  islands and then lay siege to the surrounded islands.
  <u>Admiral Chester Nimitz</u> successfully coordinated naval, air, and ground
  assaults in the Pacific.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Saipan Island</b>, <b>Tinian Island</b>, and the major islands of the
  <b>Marianas</b> fell to U.S. attackers in July and August 1944.&nbsp; From the
  Marianas, the United States' new B-29 superbombers were able to carryout
  round-trip bombing raids on Japan's home islands.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Allied Halting of Hitler</b></p>
<p>
  The <strong>Battle of the Atlantic</strong> was fought between the German's
  modern fleet of submarine <b>U-Boats</b> and <strong>Allied shipping</strong>,
  which was protected by Allied navies. The introduction of
  <strong>air patrols</strong> and <strong>radar</strong> eventually helped the
  Allies win the Battle of the Atlantic.
</p>
<p>
  The turning point in the land-air war against Hitler came in late 1942.&nbsp;
  At the Battle of <strong>El Alamein</strong> in October 1942, British general
  <u>Bernard Montgomery</u> defeated the Germans, who were led by
  <u>Marshal Erwin Rommel</u>.
</p>
<p>
  In September 1942, the Soviets repelled Hitler's attack on <b>Stalingrad</b>,
  capturing thousands of German soldiers.&nbsp; (This was the
  <strong>turning point</strong> in the war in the Soviet Union.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A Second Front from North Africa to Rome</b></p>
<p>
  Many Americans, including President Roosevelt, wanted to begin a diversionary
  invasion of France in 1942 or 1943.&nbsp; They feared that the Soviets, who
  were unable to hold out forever against Germany, might make a separate peace
  deal as they had in 1918 and leave the Western Allies to face Germany alone.
</p>
<p>
  British military planners preferred to attack Hitler through the "soft
  underbelly" of the Mediterranean.&nbsp; The Americans eventually agreed.
</p>
<p>
  American general, <u>Dwight D. Eisenhower</u> led an assault on French-held
  North Africa in November 1942.&nbsp; The invasion was the mightiest waterborne
  effort up to that time in history.&nbsp; The German-Italy army surrendered in
  <b>Tunisia</b> in May 1943.
</p>
<p>
  At <b>Casablanca</b>, President Roosevelt met with Winston Churchill in
  <b>January</b> <b>1943</b>.&nbsp; The two agreed to step up the war in the
  Pacific, invade Sicily, increase pressure on Italy, and insist upon "<strong
    >unconditional surrender</strong
  >" of the enemy.
</p>
<p>
  Allied forces captured <b> Sicily</b> in August 1943, and in <b>September</b>
  <b>1943</b>, <b>Italy</b> <b> surrendered</b> unconditionally and Mussolini
  was overthrown. Although Italy surrendered, the Germans continued to fight for
  control of Italy. <b>Rome</b> was taken on June 4, 1944.&nbsp; On
  <b>May 2, 1945 </b>(five days before Germany surrendered), thousands of Axis
  troops in Italy surrendered and became prisoners of war.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The Allies' battles in Italy diverted some German troops away from the Soviet
  and French fronts, but it delayed the Allied invasion of Normandy by several
  months. This gave the Soviets more time to take territory in Eastern Europe.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>D-Day:&nbsp; June 6, 1944</b></p>
<p>
  <u>President Roosevelt</u>, <u>Winston Churchill</u>, and <u>Stalin</u> met in
  <b>Tehran</b>, Iran from
  <b>November 28<sup>th</sup> to December 1<sup>st</sup></b> to coordinate a
  second front.&nbsp; One of the most important achievements of the meeting was
  the agreement on broad plans, especially those for launching Soviet attacks on
  Germany from the east simultaneously with the Allied assault from the west.
</p>
<p>
  Because the United States provided the most Allied troops for the invasion of
  Europe, American <u>General Eisenhower</u> was given command.
</p>
<p>
  French Normandy was chosen for the point for invasion because it was less
  heavily defended than other parts of the European coast.&nbsp; On
  <b>D-Day</b>, <b>June 6, 1944</b>, the invasion operation took place. The
  Allies broke through German beach defenses and
  <u>General George S. Patton</u> led armored divisions across France.
  <b>Paris</b> was <b>liberated</b> in <b>August</b> <b>1944</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The first important German city to fall to the Allies was <b>Aachen</b> in
  October 1944.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>FDR:&nbsp; The Fourth-Termite of 1944</b></p>
<p>
  For the <b>election of 1944</b>, the Republicans nominated
  <u>Thomas E. Dewey</u> for the presidency and isolationist Senator,
  <u>John W. Bricker</u> for the vice presidency.
</p>
<p>
  The Democrats nominated <u>Roosevelt</u> for the presidency and Senator
  <u>Harry S Truman</u> for the vice presidency.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Roosevelt Defeats Dewey</b></p>
<p>
  Roosevelt won a sweeping majority of the votes in the Electoral College and
  was <b>reelected</b>.&nbsp; He won primarily because the war was going
  well.&nbsp; Foreign policy was a decisive factor with many voters, who
  concluded that Roosevelt's experience was needed for making a future
  organization for world peace.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Last Days of Hitler</b></p>
<p>
  On <b>December 16, 1944</b>, Hitler threw all of his forces against the thinly
  held American lines in the <b>Ardennes Forest</b>.&nbsp; His objective was
  take the Belgian port of Antwerp, which was key to the Allied supply
  operation. In the <b>Battle of the Bulge</b>, the Allies were driven back,
  creating a deep "bulge" in the Allied front. The 10-day German push was
  stopped by the 101<sup>st</sup> Airborne Division, which was led by
  <u>Brigadier General A. C. McAuliffe.</u>
</p>
<p>
  In <b>April</b> <b>1945</b>, General Eisenhower's troops continued into
  Germany and discovered the <b>concentration</b> <b>camps</b> where the Nazis
  had murdered over 6 million Jews. All of the atrocities of the Holocaust were
  not discovered until the war ended.
</p>
<p>The Soviets captured <b>Berlin</b> in <b>April 1945</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Hitler</b> <b>committed</b> <b>suicide</b> on <b>April 30, 1945</b>.</p>
<p>
  On <b>April 12, 1945</b>, President Roosevelt died suddenly from a brain
  hemorrhage.&nbsp; <u>Harry S Truman</u> took over the presidency.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>May 7, 1945</b>, the German government surrendered unconditionally.
  <strong>May 8</strong> was proclaimed
  <strong>V-E (Victory in Europe) Day</strong>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Japan Dies Hard</b></p>
<p>Submarines and bombers inflicted severe damage on Japan.</p>
<p>
  Allied firebombings of Tokyo killed over 83,000 people, comparable to number
  of people killed by each atomic bomb.
</p>
<p>
  <u>General MacArthur</u> returned to the <b>Philippines</b> with 600 ships and
  250,000 troops. In <b>Leyte Gulf</b>, Japan lost a series of 3 battles took
  place from <b> October 23-26, 1944</b>; this marked the end of Japan's sea
  power.&nbsp;MacArthur then landed on the main Philippine island of Luzon in
  January 1945, capturing <b>Manila</b> in March 1945.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <b>Iwo Jima</b>, needed as an airport for damaged American bombers returning
  from Japan, was captured in March 1945. The Americans captured the island of
  <strong>Okinawa</strong> after fighting from April to June of 1945.&nbsp; The
  American navy sustained heavy losses from the "<b>kamikaze</b>" (suicide)
  Japanese pilots.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Atomic Bombs</b></p>
<p>
  By the middle of 1945, Japan was still unwilling to surrender
  <em>unconditionally</em>.
</p>
<p>
  At the <b>Potsdam conference</b> in <strong>July</strong>
  <b>1945,</b> President Truman met with Stalin and the British leader. They
  issued an ultimatum to Japan:&nbsp; surrender or be destroyed.
</p>
<p>
  America's <strong>Manhattan Project</strong> developed the atomic bomb.
  Germany was the initial intended target for the atomic bomb while it was being
  developed.
</p>
<p>
  On July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb was detonated as a test. With the
  Japanese still refusing to surrender, an <strong>atomic bomb</strong> was
  dropped on <b>Hiroshima</b> on <b>August 6, 1945</b>, killing 180,000
  people.&nbsp; On August 8, Stalin invaded the Japanese defenses of Manchuria
  and Korea.&nbsp; After the Japanese still refused to surrender, a second
  <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> was dropped on <b>Nagasaki</b> on <b>August 9</b>,
  killing 80,000 people.
</p>
<p>
  The U.S. would have had a third atomic bomb ready by August 19 and a fourth
  bomb ready by September 1945.
</p>
<p>
  On August 10, 1945, Tokyo surrendered under the condition that emperor
  <u>Hirohito</u> be allowed to keep his title as emperor.&nbsp; The Allies
  accepted this condition on <b>August 14, 1945</b>.&nbsp; The formal end to the
  war came on <b> September 2, 1945</b>, which was proclaimed as
  <strong>V-J (Victory in Japan) Day</strong>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Allies Triumphant</b></p>
<p>
  American forces suffered 1 million casualties in WWII, while the
  <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> suffered nearly <b>25 million</b>.
</p>
<p>
  After the war, much of the world was destroyed while America was left
  virtually untouched.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The nation was better prepared for the war than any other nation because it
  had begun to prepare about a year and a half before the war officially began
  (for America).

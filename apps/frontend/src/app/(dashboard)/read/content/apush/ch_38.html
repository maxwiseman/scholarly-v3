<h3>Chapter 38</h3>
<h4>The Stormy Sixties</h4>
<h4>1960-1968</h4>
<hr />
<p><b>Kennedy's "New Frontier" Spirit</b></p>
<p>
  <b> </b><u>President Kennedy</u> was the youngest president to take office. He
  assembled one of the youngest cabinets, which included his brother
  <u>Robert Kennedy</u>, the Attorney General, who planned to reform the
  priorities of the FBI.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Kennedy's pushed his "<b>New Frontier</b>" plans, which included trying to fix
  unemployment and inflation and keeping wages high for workers. This plan
  inspired patriotism. Kennedy proposed the <b>Peace Corps</b>, an army of
  idealistic and mostly youthful volunteers to bring American skills to
  underdeveloped countries.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The New Frontier at Home</b></p>
<p>
  Southern Democrats and Republicans despised the president's New Frontier
  plan.&nbsp; Kennedy had campaigned on the theme of
  <b>revitalizing the economy</b> after the recessions of the Eisenhower
  years.&nbsp; To do this, the president tried to curb <b>inflation</b>.&nbsp;
  In <b>1962</b>, he negotiated a noninflationary wage agreement with the
  <b>steel industry</b>.&nbsp; When the steel industry announced significant
  price increases, promoting inflation, President Kennedy lambasted the steel
  industry's executives. This caused the industry to lower its prices.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Kennedy stimulated the economy by <b>cutting taxes</b> and putting
  <b>more</b> <b>money</b> directly into <b>private hands</b> (instead of
  spending more government money).&nbsp; Kennedy also proposed a
  multibillion-dollar plan to land an American on the moon (<strong
    >Apollo Program</strong
  >).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Rumblings in Europe</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>August 1961</b>, the Soviets began to construct the <b>Berlin Wall</b>,
  which was designed to stop the large population drain from East Germany to
  West Germany through Berlin.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Western Europe</b> was prospering after the Marshall Plan aid and the
  growth of the <b>European Economic Community (EEC)</b> (also known as<b>
    Common Market</b
  >). The EEC was the free-trade area that evolved into the European Union.
  Kennedy secured passage of the <b>Trade Expansion Act</b> in <b>1962</b>,
  authorizing tariff cuts of up to 50% to promote trade between America and the
  Common Market countries.
</p>
<p>
  American policymakers were dedicated to an economically and militarily united
  "Atlantic Community" with the United States the dominant partner.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In 1963, president of <b>France</b>, <u>Charles de Gaulle</u>, vetoed
  Britain's application for Common Market membership. He feared that Britain's
  "special relationship" with the United States would allow the U.S. to
  indirectly control European affairs.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Foreign Flare-ups and "Flexible Response"</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1954</b>, <b>Laos</b> gained its independence from France and it erupted
  in violence. Kennedy avoided sending troops, and peace was ultimately achieved
  at the Geneva conference in <b>1962</b>.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Defense Secretary Robert McNamara</u> pushed the strategy of "<b
    >flexible response</b
  >". This was the idea that America would deploy military options around the
  world that could match the necessities of the crisis at hand.&nbsp; President
  Kennedy increased spending on the Special Forces.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Stepping into the Vietnam Quagmire</b></p>
<p>
  The doctrine of "flexible response" lowered the level at which diplomacy would
  give way to troops. It provided a way for a progressively and increasing use
  of force (ex: Vietnam).
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1961</b>, Kennedy increased the number of "<b>military advisors</b>" in
  <b>South Vietnam</b> to protect <u>Diem</u> (president of South Vietnam) from
  the communists.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>November 1963</b>, after being fed up with U.S. economic aid being
  embezzled by Diem, the Kennedy encouraged a successful coup and killed Diem.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Modernization Theory:</strong> the idea that the traditional societies
  in Asia, Africa, and Latin America could develop into prosperous, democratic
  countries by following America's lead.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Cuban Confrontations</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1961</b>, President Kennedy signed the <b>Alliance for Progress</b>,
  which was essentially the Marshall Plan for Latin America. Its primary goal
  was to help the Latin American countries close the gap between the rich and
  the poor, thus quieting communist politicians. Results were disappointing as
  America's money did not impact Latin America's social problems.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>April 17, 1961</b>, 1,200 American-supported Cuban exiles landed at<b>
    Cuba's Bay of Pigs</b
  >. This was an attempt by America to overthrow the Castro regime. President
  Kennedy was against the <i>direct</i>
  intervention of the overthrow of Castro, so he did not provide sufficient
  support for the exiles. Hence, the invasion failed after the exiles were
  forced to surrender.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Continued American attempt to overthrow Castro caused Castro to further
  support the Soviets. In <b>October 1962</b>, it was discovered that the
  <b>Soviets</b> were secretly installing <b>nuclear</b> <b>missiles</b> in
  <b> Cuba</b>.&nbsp; Kennedy ordered a naval "<b>quarantine</b>" of Cuba and
  demanded immediate removal of the weapons.&nbsp; For a <b>week</b>, Americans
  waited while Soviet ships approached the patrol line established by the U.S.
  Navy off the island of Cuba.&nbsp;On <b>October 28</b>, Khrushchev agreed to a
  compromise in which he would pull the missiles out of Cuba.&nbsp; The
  Americans also agreed to end the quarantine and not invade the island. This
  ended the <strong>Cuban Missile Crisis</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  In late <b>1963</b>, a <b>pact</b>
  <b>prohibiting trial nuclear explosions</b> in the atmosphere was
  signed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In <b>June 1963</b>, President Kennedy gave a speecin which he encouraged
  Americans to <b>abandon</b> the <b>negative</b> <b>views</b> of the Soviet
  Union.&nbsp; He tried to lay the foundations for a realistic policy of
  <b>peaceful</b> <b>coexistence</b> with the Soviet Union.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Struggle for Civil Rights</b></p>
<p>
  During his campaign, JFK had gained the black vote by stating that he would
  pass civil rights legislation, but he was slow to pass legislation during his
  presidency (he didn't want to lose support from southern Congressmen).
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1960</b>, groups of <b>Freedom Riders</b> in the South tried to end
  segregation in facilities serving interstate bus passengers. When southern
  officials did nothing to stop violence that had erupted at these protests,
  federal marshals were dispatched to protect the freedom riders.
</p>
<p>
  For the most part, the <b>Kennedy</b> <b>family</b> and the <b>King</b>
  <b>family</b> (Martin Luther King, Jr.) had a good relationship.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Voter Education Project</b> sought to register the South's historically
  disfranchised blacks.
</p>
<p>
  In the spring of <b>1963</b>, Martin Luther King, Jr. launched a campaign
  against discrimination in <b>Birmingham</b>, Alabama, the most segregated big
  city in America.&nbsp; Civil rights marchers were repelled by police with
  attack dogs and high-pressure water hoses.&nbsp; In shock, President Kennedy
  delivered a speech to the nation on June 11, 1963 in which he dedicated
  himself to finding a solution to the racial problems.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>August 1963</b>, Martin Luther King, Jr. led 200,000 black and white
  demonstrators on a peaceful "<b>March on Washington</b>" in support of the
  proposed new civil rights legislation.

<p><b>The Killing of Kennedy</b></p>
<p>
  On <b>November 22, 1963</b>, <u>President Kennedy</u> was shot and
  <b>killed</b> as he was riding in an open limousine in Dallas, Texas.&nbsp;
  The alleged gunman was <u>Lee Harvey Oswald</u>.&nbsp; Oswald was shot and
  killed by self-appointed avenger, <u>Jack Ruby</u>.&nbsp;
  <u>Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson</u> was sworn into office, retaining most
  of Kennedy's cabinet.&nbsp; Kennedy was praised more for his ideals than what
  he had actually achieved.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The LBJ Brand on the Presidency</b></p>
<p>
  President Johnson convinced Congress to pass the
  <b>Civil Rights Act of 1964</b>, banning racial discrimination in most private
  facilities open to the public.&nbsp; It strengthened the federal government's
  power to end segregation in schools and other public places.&nbsp; It also
  created the federal
  <b>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</b> (<b>EEOC</b>) to eliminate
  discrimination in hiring (race, national origin, gender).
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1965</b>, President Johnson issued an executive order requiring all
  federal contractors to take "<b>affirmative action</b>" against
  discrimination.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Johnson started a "War on Poverty."&nbsp; His domestic program, called the "<b
    >Great Society</b
  >", was a set of New Dealish economic and welfare measures tried to reduce
  poverty and racial discrimination.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Johnson Battles Goldwater in 1964</b></p>
<p>
  The Democrats nominated <u>Lyndon Johnson</u> to run for president for the
  <b>election of 1964</b>.&nbsp; The Republicans chose Senator
  <u> Barry Goldwater</u>.&nbsp; Goldwater attacked the federal income tax, the
  Social Security System, the Tennessee Valley Authority, civil rights
  legislation, the nuclear test-ban treaty, and the Great Society.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>August 2th and August 4th</b>, two U.S. ships were
  <strong>allegedly</strong> fired upon.&nbsp; Johnson called the attack
  "unprovoked" and moved to make political gains out of the incident.&nbsp;He
  used the event to get Congress to pass the <b>Tonkin Gulf Resolution</b>. This
  basically let the president use unrestricted force (at his discretion) in
  Southeast Asia.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><u>Lyndon Johnson</u> overwhelmingly <b>won</b> the election of 1964.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Great Society Congress</b></p>
<p>
  Congress passed many bills in support of the Great Society plan.<b> </b> In
  the War on Poverty, Congress gave more money to the Office of Economic
  Opportunity and it created two new cabinet offices:&nbsp; the
  <b>Department of Transportation</b> and the
  <b>Department of Housing and Urban Development</b> (<b>HUD</b>).&nbsp; The
  <b>National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities</b> was designed to
  raise the level of American cultural life.
</p>
<p>
  In regards to the Great Society plan, LBJ's
  <strong>big four legislative achievements</strong> were:
  <b>aid to education</b>, <b>medical care for the elderly and poor</b>,
  <b>immigration reform</b>, and a <b>new voting rights bill</b>.&nbsp; Johnson
  gave <b>educational aid</b> to <b>students</b>, not schools.&nbsp; In
  <b>1965, </b>Congress created <b>Medicare</b> for the elderly and
  <b>Medicaid</b> for the poor.&nbsp; The
  <b>Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965</b> abolished the quota system that
  had been in place since 1921.&nbsp; It also doubled the number of immigrants
  allowed to enter the country annually.&nbsp; The sources of immigration
  shifted from Europe to Latin America and Asia. Conservatives said that poverty
  could not be fixed by the Great Society programs, but the poverty rate did
  decline in the following decade.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Battling for Black Rights</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>Civil Rights Act of 1964</b> gave the federal government more power to
  enforce school-desegregation orders and to prohibit racial discrimination in
  public accommodations and employment.
</p>
<p>
  President Johnson realized the problem that few blacks were registered to
  vote.&nbsp; The <b>24<sup>th</sup> Amendment</b>, passed in <b>1964</b>,
  abolished the poll tax in federal elections. In response to racial violence
  across the South, Congress passed the <b>Voting Rights Act of 1965</b>, which
  sought to prohibit minorities from being disenfranchised (through poll taxes,
  literacy tests, etc).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Black Power</b></p>
<p>
  Days after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, a bloody riot erupted in
  <b>Watts</b>, a black ghetto in Los Angeles.&nbsp; The
  <b>Watts explosion</b> marked increasing militant confrontation in the black
  struggle.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <u>Malcolm X</u> was an African-American Muslim minister who rallied black
  separatism. In <b>1965</b>, he was shot and killed by a rival Nation of Islam.
</p>
<p>
  Racially-motivated violence continued to spread as the militant<b>
    Black Panther</b
  >
  party emerged. It openly carried weapons in the streets of Oakland,
  California.&nbsp; <u>Stokely Carmichael</u> preached the doctrine of
  <strong>Black Power</strong>, which emphasized racial pride and the creation
  of black political and cultural parties.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;On <b>April 4, 1968</b>, <u>Martin Luther King, Jr.</u> was shot and
  killed by a sniper in Memphis, Tennessee.&nbsp; Black voter registration
  eventually increased, and by the late 1960s, several hundred blacks held
  elected positions in the South.
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Combating Communism in Two Hemispheres</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>April 1965</b>, President Johnson sent 25,000 troops to the
  <b>Dominican Republic</b> to restore order after a revolt against the military
  government started.&nbsp; Johnson claimed, with shaky evidence, that the
  Dominican Republic was the target of a Castro-like coup.&nbsp; He was widely
  condemned for his actions.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>February 1965</b>, Viet Cong guerrillas attacked an American air base at
  <b>Pleiku</b>, <b>South Vietnam</b>. By the middle of <b>March 1965</b>, "<b
    >Operation Rolling Thunder</b
  >" was in full swing. This involved regular bombing attacks against North
  Vietnam. LBJ believed that an orderly escalation of American force in Vietnam
  would defeat the enemy.
</p>
<p>
  The conflict in Vietnam became very <b>Americanized</b>.&nbsp;Pro-war hawks
  argued that if the United Sates left Vietnam, other nations would doubt
  America's word and succumb to communism.&nbsp; By 1968, Johnson had put more
  than 500,000 troops in Southeast Asia, and the annual cost for the war was
  over $30 billion.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Vietnam Vexations</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>June 1967</b>, <b>Israel</b> launched a pre-emptive attack on Egypt's
  airforce, starting the <b>Six-Day War</b>. Following the war, Israel gained
  the territories of the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Antiwar demonstrations</b> increased significantly as more and more
  American soldiers died in the Vietnam War.
  <u>Senator William Fulbright</u> held a series of televised hearings in 1966
  and 1967 in which he convinced the public that it had been deceived about the
  causes and "winnability" of the war.
</p>
<p>
  When <u>Defense Secretary McNamara</u> expressed discomfort about the war, he
  was quietly removed from office.
</p>
<p>
  By early 1968, the Vietnam War had become the longest and most unpopular
  foreign war in the nation's history. The government failed to justify the war.
  Casualties exceeded 100,000, and more bombs had been dropped in Vietnam than
  in World War II.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1967</b>, Johnson ordered the <b>CIA</b> to spy on
  <strong>domestic</strong> antiwar activists.&nbsp; He also encouraged the
  <b>FBI</b> to use its counterintelligence program, code-named
  "<b>Cointelpro</b>," to investigate members of the peace movement.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Vietnam Topples Johnson</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>January 1968</b>, the Viet Cong (VC) attacked 27 key South Vietnamese
  cities, including Saigon.&nbsp; The <b>Tet Offensive </b>ended in a military
  defeat for the VC, but it caused the American public to demand an immediate
  end to the war. President Johnson began to doubt the wisdom of continuing to
  send troops to Vietnam.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Eugene McCarthy</u> and <u>Robert F. Kennedy</u> entered the race for the
  1968 Democratic presidential nomination.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>March 31, 1968</b>, President Johnson stated that he would freeze
  American troop levels and gradually shift more responsibility to the South
  Vietnamese.&nbsp; Bombings would also be scaled down.&nbsp; He also declared
  that he would not be a candidate for the presidency in 1968.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Presidential Sweepstakes of 1968</b></p>
<p>
  On <b>June 5, 1968</b>, <u>Robert Kennedy</u> was shot and <b>killed</b> by an
  Arab immigrant resentful of the Kennedy's pro-Israel views.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <u>Hubert H. Humphrey</u>, vice president of Johnson, won the Democratic
  nomination. Humphrey supported the increased use of force in Vietnam.
</p>
<p>
  The Republicans nominated <u>Richard Nixon</u> for president and
  <u>Spiro T. Agnew</u> for vice president.&nbsp; The Republican platform called
  for a victory in Vietnam and a strong anticrime policy.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>American Independent party</b>, headed by <u>George C. Wallace</u>,
  called for the of segregation of blacks.
</p>
<p>
  The Republican and Democrat candidates supported the Vietnam War in the
  election of 1968.
</p>
<p>
  Despite winning most major cities and about 95% of the black vote, the
  Democrats lost the election; <u>Richard Nixon</u> won the
  <b>election of 1968</b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Obituary of Lyndon Johnson</b></p>
<p>
  No president since Lincoln had done more for civil rights than LBJ.&nbsp; The
  Vietnam War sucked tax dollars away from LBJ's Great Society programs, though.
</p>
<p>
  LBJ was persuaded by his advisors that an easy victory in Vietnam could be
  achieved by massive aerial bombing and large troop commitments.&nbsp;He did
  not want to continue to escalate the fighting, though, and this offended the
  war "hawks." His refusal to end the war also offended the war "doves."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Cultural Upheaval of the 1960s</b></p>
<p>
  In 1960s in America, a negative attitude toward all kinds of authority took
  hold.&nbsp;The <b>Free Speech Movement</b> was one of the first organized
  protests <b>against</b> established <b>authority</b>. It took place at the
  <b>University of California at Berkeley</b> in <b>1964</b>. Leader
  <u> Mario Savio</u> condemned the impersonal university "machine."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  From the 1950s to the 1970s, educated people became more secular and
  uneducated people became more religious.
</p>
<p>
  Protests against government took place around the world, including France,
  China, and Czechoslovakia.
</p>
<p>
  The 1960s also witnessed a "<b>sexual revolution</b>."&nbsp; The introduction
  of the birth control pill made unwanted pregnancies easy to avoid.&nbsp; By
  the 1960s, gay men and lesbians were increasingly emerging and demanding
  sexual tolerance.&nbsp;The <strong>Stonewall Rebellion</strong> was a series
  of riots that emerged when off-duty police officers attacked gay men. Worries
  in the 1980s of AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases slowed the sexual
  revolution.
</p>
<p>
  By the end of the 1960s, <b>students for a Democratic Society</b> (<b>SDS</b>)
  had created an underground terrorist group called the <b> Weathermen</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The upheavals of the 1960s could be attributed to the three <i>P</i>s:&nbsp;
  the youthful <strong>population</strong> bulge,
  <strong>protest</strong> against racism and the Vietnam War, and the apparent
  permanence of <strong>prosperity</strong>.

<h3>Chapter 30</h3>
<h4>The War to End War</h4>
<h4>1917-1918</h4>
<hr />
<p>
  On January 31, 1917, Germany announced its decision to wage unrestricted
  submarine warfare on all ships, including American ships, in the war zone.
  Germany hoped that this act would take Britain out of the war before the
  Americans joined.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>War by Act of Germany</b></p>
<p>
  German foreign secretary, <u>Arthur Zimmermann</u> secretly proposed a
  German-Mexican alliance with the <b>Zimmermann</b> <b>note</b>.&nbsp; News of
  the Zimmermann note leaked out to the public, infuriating Americans.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  On April 2, 1917, President Wilson asked for a declaration of war from
  Congress after 4 more unarmed merchant ships were sunk.
</p>
<p>
  <b>3 Mains Causes of the War</b>:&nbsp; Zimmermann Note, Germany declares
  unrestricted submarine warfare, Bolshevik Revolution.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Wilsonian Idealism Enthroned</b></p>
<p>
  President Wilson persuaded the American public to support war by declaring
  that America would be fighting "for a war to end war" and "to make the world
  safe for democracy."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Wilson's Fourteen Potent Points</b></p>
<p>
  Wilson delivered his <b>Fourteen Points Address</b> to Congress on January 8,
  1918. The message declared that WWI was being fought for a moral cause and it
  called for post-war peace in Europe. The message gave Wilson the position of
  moral leadership of the Allies.
</p>
<p>The first 5 points and their effects were:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  1) A proposal to abolish secret treaties pleased liberals of all countries.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  2) Freedom of the seas appealed to the Germans, as well as to Americans who
  distrusted British sea power.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  3) A removal of economic barriers among nations was comforting to Germany,
  which feared postwar vengeance.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  4) Reduction of armament burdens was gratifying to taxpayers.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  5) An adjustment of colonial claims in the interests of both native people and
  the colonizers was reassuring to the anti-imperialists.
</p>
<p>
  The largest point, #14, foreshadowed the <b>League of Nations</b> - an
  international organization that Wilson dreamed would provide a system of
  collective security.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Creel Manipulates Minds</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>Committee on Public Information</b> was created to rally public support
  of war.&nbsp; It was led by <u>George Creel</u> whose job was to sell America
  on the war and to sell the world on Wilsonian war goals.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Enforcing Loyalty and Stifling Dissent</b></p>
<p>
  There were over 8 million German-Americans in America, and rumors began to
  spread of spying and sabotage.&nbsp; A hysterical hatred of Germans and things
  related to Germany swept the nation.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Espionage Act of 1917</b> sought to prevent support of U.S. enemies
  during wartime. The <b>Sedition Act of 1918</b> made it illegal to speak out
  against the government. Socialist <u>Eugene V. Debs</u> and the Industrial
  Workers of the World (IWW) leader <u> William D. Haywood</u> were convicted
  under the Espionage Act.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  At this time, any criticism of the government could be censored and
  punished.&nbsp; The Supreme Court upheld these laws in
  <b><i>Schenck v. United States</i></b> (<b>1919</b>); it argued that freedom
  of speech could be revoked when such speech posed a danger to the nation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Nation's Factories Go to War</b></p>
<p>
  Before the war, President Wilson created a
  <b>Civilian Council of National Defense</b> to study problems of economic
  mobilization. He had also increased the size of the army and created a
  shipbuilding program.
</p>
<p>
  Fears of big government restricted efforts to coordinate the economy from
  Washington.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1918</b>, Wilson appointed <u>Bernard Baruch</u> to head the <b>War</b>
  <b>Industries</b> <b>Board</b> to create order over the economic
  confusion.&nbsp; The Board never had much control, but it set a precedent for
  how the Federal government would handle the economy in times of crisis.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Workers in Wartime</b></p>
<p>
  Workers were discouraged from striking by the War Department's decree in 1918
  that threatened to draft any unemployed male.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>National War Labor Board</strong> tried to fix labor disputes
  before they hurt the war effort. The <b>IWW</b> (<b
    >Industrial Workers of the World</b
  >) had some of the worst working conditions in the country.&nbsp; The
  <b>AF of L</b>'s (American Federation of Labor) supported the war and because
  of this, membership had more than doubled by the end of the war.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Wartime inflation reduced wage gains; this led to thousands of strikes across
  the country.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1919</b>, the greatest strike in American history hit the <b>steel</b>
  <b>industry</b>.&nbsp; More than 250,000 steelworkers went on strike, seeking
  the right to organize and collectively bargain. The steel companies refused to
  negotiate, and they brought in 30,000 African-Americans to keep the mills
  running. The strike eventually collapsed, crippling the union movement.
</p>
<p>
  Thousands of blacks moved to the North in search of war-industry
  employment.&nbsp;Deadly disputes between whites and blacks broke out.

<p><b>Suffering Until Suffrage</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>National Woman's party</b>, led by <u>Alice Paul</u>, protested the
  war.
</p>
<p>
  The larger part of the <b>suffrage movement</b>, represented by the
  <b>National American Woman Suffrage Association</b>, supported the war.
</p>
<p>
  After men left the country to fight in the war, women took up the factory and
  field jobs. Impressed by this work, President Wilson supported passage of the
  <b>19<sup>th</sup> Amendment</b> (1920), which gave all American women the
  right to vote.
</p>
<p>
  Congress passed the <b>Sheppard-Towner Maternity Act of 1921</b>, which gave
  federally financed instruction in maternal and infant health care.
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Forging a War Economy</b></p>
<p>
  <u>Herbert C. Hoover</u> led the <b>Food Administration</b>.&nbsp;Unlike
  Europe, Hoover did not want to use ration cards to save food for export.
  Instead, he initiated wheatless Wednesdays and meatless Tuesdays. Like the
  other war administrators, this was on a voluntary basis.
</p>
<p>
  Congress restricted the use of foodstuffs for manufacturing alcoholic
  beverages. This helped to accelerate the move to prohibition.&nbsp; In
  <b>1919</b>, the <b>18<sup>th</sup> Amendment</b> was passed, prohibiting all
  alcoholic drinks.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Making Plowboys into Doughboys</b></p>
<p>
  Although President Wilson initially opposed a draft, he eventually realized
  that a draft was necessary to raise the large army that was to be sent to
  France. Congress passed the <b>draft act</b> in <b>1917</b>.&nbsp; It required
  the registration of all males between the ages of 18 and 45, and it did not
  allow for a man to purchase his exemption from the draft.
</p>
<p>For the first time, women were allowed in the armed forces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fighting in France-Belatedly</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1917</b>, the <b>Bolshevik Revolution</b> (communist) in Russia
  overthrew the tsar regime. The new regime decided to pull Russia out of the
  "capitalist" war. This freed up thousands of Germans on the Russian front to
  fight against France on the western front.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  A year after Congress declared war, the first American troops reached
  France.&nbsp; They were used as replacements in the Allied armies and were
  generally deployed in quiet sectors with the British and French.&nbsp;
  Shipping shortages plagued the Allies.
</p>
<p>
  American troops were also sent to Belgium, Italy, and Russia. Americas were
  sent to Russia because they hoped to prevent Russian munitions from falling
  into the hands of the Germans.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>America Helps Hammer the "Hun"</b></p>
<p>
  In the spring of <b>1918</b>, the Allies, for the first time, united under a
  supreme commander, <u>French marshal Foch</u> to fight the German expansion on
  the western front.
</p>
<p>
  To stop Germany from taking Paris and France, 30,000 American troops were sent
  to the French frontlines.&nbsp; This was the first significant engagement of
  American troops in a European war.
</p>
<p>
  By <b>July</b> <b>1918</b>, the German expansion was halted and Foch made a
  counteroffensive in the <b>Second Battle of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Marne</b>.&nbsp;
  This engagement marked the beginning of a German withdrawal.
</p>
<p>
  The Americans, dissatisfied with simply bolstering the French and British,
  demanded a separate army; General <u>John J. Pershing</u> was assigned a front
  of 85 miles.&nbsp; Pershing's army undertook the <b>Meuse-Argonne</b>
  <b>offensive</b> from September 26 to November 11, 1918.&nbsp; One objective
  was to cut the German railroad lines feeding the western front.&nbsp;
  Inadequate training left 10% of the Americans involved in the battle injured
  or killed.
</p>
<p>
  As German supplies ran low and as their allies began to desert them, defeat
  was in sight for Germany.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Fourteen Points Disarm Germany</b></p>
<p>
  Germany surrendered on <b>November 11, 1918</b>, after the kaiser of Germany
  had fled to Holland.
</p>
<p>
  The United States' main contributions to the victory had been foodstuffs,
  munitions, credits, oil, and manpower.&nbsp; The Americans only fought
  <b>2 major battles</b>, at <b>St. Mihiel </b>and the
  <b>Meuse-Argonne</b>.&nbsp; The prospect of endless U.S. troops, rather than
  America's actual military performance eventually demoralized the Germans.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Wilson Steps Down from Olympus</b></p>
<p>
  President Wilson had gained a lot support throughout the world because he was
  viewed as the moral leader of the war.
</p>
<p>
  Leading up to the <b>congressional elections of November 1918</b>, Wilson
  asked the public to re-elect a Democratic majority in Congress. He thought it
  would help him negotiate and pass a treaty. This angered much of the public,
  and voters instead elected a Republican majority to Congress.
</p>
<p>
  Wilson's decision to go to Paris in person to negotiate the treaty infuriated
  the Republicans because no president had ever traveled to Europe.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>An Idealist Amid the Imperialists</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>Paris Conference</b> was dominated by the <b>Big Four</b>:
  <b>United States, Italy, Britain, France.</b>&nbsp; President
  <u>Wilson</u> (led the conference) was joined by Premier
  <u>Vittorio Orlando </u>of Italy, Prime Minister <u>David Lloyd George</u> of
  Britain, and Premier <u>Georges Clemenceau</u> of France.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Wilson's ultimate goal was the creation of the<b> League of Nations</b>.&nbsp;
  It would contain an assembly with seats for all nations and a council to be
  controlled by the great powers.&nbsp; Wilson envisioned it as a way to prevent
  future world wars. In February 1919, the the Big Four
  <strong>agreed</strong> to include the creation of the League in the treaty.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Hammering Out the Treaty</b></p>
<p>
  Some<b> Republicans</b> in America hated the League of Nations and refused to
  approve the treaty. These difficulties helped Wilson's Allied adversaries in
  Paris because they were given a stronger bargaining position; Wilson would
  have to beg them for changes in the treaty that would safeguard the Monroe
  Doctrine and other American interests.
</p>
<p>
  <b>France</b> gave up claims for the <b>Saar Valley</b> (part of Germany); it
  would remain separate from France for 15 years, and then a popular vote would
  determine its fate. In exchange for this, Britain and America agreed to the
  <b>Security Treaty</b>: American and Britain would defend France if Germany
  invaded again.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Italy</b> demanded <b>Fiume</b>, a valuable seaport inhabited by both
  Italians and Yugoslavs. Wilson wanted it to go to the Yugoslavs, but this was
  opposed by the Italians. Ownership of the area was ultimately not established.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Japan</b> demanded China's <b>Shandong</b> <b>Peninsula</b> and the German
  islands of the Pacific, which it had seized during the war.&nbsp; After Japan
  threatened to walk out, Wilson accepted a compromise in which Japan kept
  Germany's economic holdings in Shandong and pledged to return the peninsula to
  China at a later date.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Peace Treaty That Bred a New War</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>Treaty of Versailles</b> was forced upon the Germans in June
  <b>1919</b>.&nbsp; The Germans were outraged with the treaty, which spoke more
  of vengeance than reconciliation. Most of the Fourteen Points were left out of
  the treaty.
</p>
<p>
  Wilson compromised away some of his Fourteen Points in attempts to salvage the
  League of Nations.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Domestic Parade of Prejudice</b></p>
<p>
  Critics of the League of Nations came from many different political groups in
  America.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Wilson's Tour and Collapse (1919)</b></p>
<p>
  The Republicans in Congress had no real hope of defeating the
  <b>Treaty of Versailles</b>; they hoped to "Republicanize" it so that the
  Republicans could claim political credit for the changes.
</p>
<p>
  In an attempt to speed up the passing of the treaty in the Senate, President
  Wilson decided to give speeches across the country to appeal to the public.
  The speeches had mixed reactions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>During the tour, Wilson suffered a stroke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Defeat Through Deadlock</b></p>
<p>
  <u>Senator Lodge</u>, a critic to the president, came up with
  <b>fourteen reservations</b> to the Treaty of Versailles. He wanted to give
  the U.S. more control over how it interacted with other nations and how these
  nations interacted with it.
</p>
<p>
  Wilson strongly opposed the reservations, and after the Senate rejected the
  Treaty twice, the Treaty of Versailles was <b>defeated</b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The "Solemn Referendum" of 1920</b></p>
<p>
  Wilson decided to settle the treaty issue in the presidential campaign of
  1920; if voters elected a Democrat, then this would mean they supported the
  treaty.
</p>
<p>
  The Republicans chose Senator <u>Warren G. Harding</u> as their presidential
  nominee for the election of 1920.&nbsp; Their vice-presidential nominee was
  Governor <u>Calvin Coolidge</u>.&nbsp; The Republican platform appealed to
  both pro-League and anti-League sentiment in the party.
</p>
<p>
  Democrats nominated pro-League Governor <u>James. M. Cox</u> for president and
  chose <u>Franklin D. Roosevelt</u> for vice-president.
</p>
<p>
  Warren Harding won the <b>election of 1920</b>.&nbsp; Harding's victory led to
  the death of the League of Nations.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Betrayal of Great Expectations</b></p>
<p>
  After WWI, America became isolationist and it did not embrace a role as a
  global leader. In the interests of its own security, the United States should
  have used its enormous strength to shape the world.&nbsp; It instead allowed
  the world to drift towards another war.

<h3>Chapter 36</h3>
<h4>The Cold War Begins</h4>
<h4>1945-1952</h4>
<hr />
<p><b>Postwar Economic Anxieties</b></p>
<p>
  In the initial postwar years, the economy struggled and prices of consumer
  goods increased because the wartime price controls were removed.&nbsp; An
  series of <b>strikes</b> swept over the country in 1946.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1947</b>, the Republican Congress passed the
  <b> Taft-Hartley Act</b> over President Truman's veto.&nbsp; It outlawed
  "closed" (all-union) businesses, made unions liable for damages that resulted
  from jurisdictional disputes among themselves, and required union leaders to
  take a noncommunist oath.&nbsp; Taft-Hartley was just one of several obstacles
  that slowed the growth of organized labor in the years following WWII.
</p>
<p>
  The CIO's "<b>Operation Dixie</b>," tried to unionize southern textile workers
  and steelworkers. It failed in 1948 because it couldn't overcome fears of
  racial mixing.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>Employment Act of 1946 </strong>created a 3-member Council of
  Economic Advisers to advise the president on policies regarding employment,
  production, and purchasing power.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944</b> (GI Bill of Rights /
  <b>GI Bill)</b>, made money available to send former WWII soldiers to school.
  This bill raised educational levels and stimulated the construction industry;
  this helped to create the economic expansion that started in the late 1940s.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Long Economic Boom, 1950-1970</b></p>
<p>
  From 1950s to the 1970s, the American <b>economy</b> grew rapidly. Incomes
  rose, the middle class expanded, and Americans accounted for 40% of the
  planet's wealth. The economic growth changed the face of politics and society.
  It paved the war for the success of the civil rights movement; it funded new
  welfare programs; and it gave Americans the confidence to exercise
  international leadership in the Cold War era.
</p>
<p>
  Most new jobs created after WWII went to <b>women</b>, as the service sector
  of the economy dramatically outgrew the old industrial and manufacturing
  sectors.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Roots of Postwar Prosperity</b></p>
<p>
  WWII boosted the American economy, but large increases in<strong>
    military spending</strong
  >
  helped sustain the economic growth. The increased military budget helped start
  high-technology industries like aerospace, plastics, and electronics.&nbsp;
  Low-cost petroleum from the Middle East (prices were controlled by Europe
  &amp; America) caused America to significantly increase its energy
  consumption.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Productivity</strong> was the key to prosperity for America. Increased
  productivity was caused by <strong>improved technology</strong> and the<strong>
    rising educational level</strong
  >
  of the workforce.
</p>
<p>
  Mechanization and fertilizers increased the productivity of farms. Because of
  this, less people were needed to work on farms, and the work force shifted out
  of agriculture.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Smiling Sunbelt</b></p>
<p>
  Economic prosperity caused by WWII enabled people to move about the country at
  a higher rate than in the past (<strong>population mobility</strong>).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The "<b>Sunbelt</b>" is a 15-state area stretching along the southern portion
  of the U.S. from Virginia to California. The population in this region grew
  nearly twice as fast as in the Northeast (the "<b>Frostbelt</b>").&nbsp; In
  the 1950s, California alone accounted for 1/5 of the nation's population
  growth. It became the most populous state in 1963.
</p>
<p>
  People moved to the sunbelt in search of jobs, better climate, and lower
  taxes. The sunbelt states' economic prosperity was large due to the fact that
  this region received significantly more federal money that the North. The
  industrial region of the Ohio Valley (the "<b>Rustbelt</b>") was especially
  hit hard as a result of the loss in federal funds and population.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Rush to the Suburbs</b></p>
<p>
  Throughout the country, home ownership became increasingly popular and many
  white Americans moved from the city to the newly created suburbs. The
  <b>Federal Housing Administration</b> (<b>FHA</b>) and
  <b>Veterans Administration</b> (<b>VA</b>) made home-loan guarantees, making
  it more economical to own a home in the suburbs rather than rent an apartment
  in the city.
</p>
<p>The construction industry expanded in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>
  "<b>White flight</b>" to the suburbs left the inner cities
  <b>poverty</b>-stricken.&nbsp;Migrating blacks from the South moved into the
  abandoned inner cities. The FHA often refused blacks home mortgages for
  private home purchases, thus limiting black mobility out of the inner cities.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Postwar Baby Boom</b></p>
<p>
  In the 15 years after 1945, the <b>birth rate</b> in the United States
  exploded as the "<b>baby boom</b>" took place.&nbsp; More than 50 million
  babies were born by the end of the 1950s.&nbsp; By 1973, the birth rates had
  dropped below the point necessary to maintain existing population figures.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Truman:&nbsp; The "Gutty" Man from Missouri</b></p>
<p>
  <u>President Harry S. Truman</u> was the first president, in several years, to
  not have a college degree. He was known as the "average man's average
  man."&nbsp; He had the ability to face difficulty with courage.

<p><b>Yalta:&nbsp; Bargain or Betrayal?</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>February 1945</b>, the <b>Big Three</b> (Roosevelt, Churchill, and
  Stalin) met in <b>Yalta</b> to discuss the war's end (<strong
    >Yalta Conference</strong
  >). Plans were made for the occupation of Germany. It was agreed that
  <b>Poland,</b> <b> Bulgaria</b>, and <b>Romania</b> should have free
  elections. Stalin eventually broke this agreement. The Big Three also
  announced plans for fashioning a new international peacekeeping organization
  (the <b>United Nations</b>).
</p>
<p>
  The most controversial decision regarded the <b>Far East</b>. American
  casualties were expected to be high in the war against Japan, so Stalin agreed
  to attack Japan after the collapse of Germany. In return, the Soviets were
  given the southern half of Sakhalin Island, lost by Russia to Japan in 1905,
  and Japan's Kurile Islands.&nbsp; The Soviet Union was also given control over
  the railroads of China's Manchuria and special privileges in the two key
  seaports of that area, <b>Dairen</b> and <b>Port Arthur</b>. &nbsp;These
  concessions gave Stalin control over vital industrial centers of China.
</p>
<p>
  The agreements at the Yalta Conference were not really binding. The conference
  was more of a way for the Big Three to discuss general post-war plans.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The United States and the Soviet Union</b></p>
<p>
  The United States terminated the USSR's much-needed lend-lease aid in 1945. It
  also ignored Moscow's plea for a $6 billion reconstruction loan, while
  approving a similar loan of $3.75 billion to Britain in 1946.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The USSR sought to guarantee its own security by creating a "<strong
    >sphere of influence</strong
  >" around it (a surrounding set of friendly countries). These spheres of
  influence contradicted President FDR's Wilsonian dream of an "<b>open world</b
  >," decolonized, demilitarized, and democratized.
</p>
<p>
  Each country believed in the universal expanse of its own form of government.
  The Soviet Union and the United States provoked each other into a tense,
  40-year standoff known as the <b>Cold War</b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Shaping the Postwar World</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1944</b>, the <b>Western Allies</b> met at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire
  (<strong>Bretton Woods Conference</strong>) and established the
  <b>International Monetary Fund</b> (<b>IMF</b>) to encourage world trade by
  regulating currency exchange rates.&nbsp; They also founded the
  <b>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development</b> (<b>World Bank</b
  >) to promote economic growth in underdeveloped areas.&nbsp; Unlike after WWI,
  the United States took the lead in creating the important international bodies
  and supplied most of their funding after WWII.&nbsp; The Soviets declined to
  participate.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>United Nations Conference</b> opened on <b>April 25, 1945</b>.
  Representatives from 50 nations made the <b>United Nations charter</b>.&nbsp;
  It included the <b>Security Council</b>, dominated by the <b>Big</b>
  <b>Five</b> <b> powers</b> (the <b>United States</b>, <b>Britain</b>, the
  <b>USSR</b>, <b>France</b>, and <b>China</b>), each of whom had the right of
  veto, and the <b>General Assembly</b>, which could be controlled by smaller
  countries.&nbsp; The Senate overwhelmingly passed the document on July 28,
  1945.
</p>
<p>
  The U.N. has helped people throughout the world via organizations like
  <b>UNESCO</b> (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
  Organization), <b>FAO</b> (Food and Agricultural Organization), and
  <b>WHO</b> (World Health Organization).
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1946</b>, <u>Bernard Baruch</u> wanted to create a U.N. <b> agency</b>,
  free from the great-power veto, with <b>worldwide authority</b> over
  <b>atomic energy</b>, weapons, and research.&nbsp; The plan fell apart as
  neither the United States nor the Soviet Union wanted to give up their nuclear
  weapons.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Problem of Germany</b></p>
<p>
  At <b>Nuremberg</b>, <b>Germany</b> from <b>1945-1946</b>, <b>Nazi</b>
  <b>leaders</b> were tried and punished for <b>war</b> <b>crimes</b>.&nbsp;
  Punishments included hangings and long jail sentences.
</p>
<p>
  Americans realized that a flourishing German economy was necessary to the
  recovery of Europe. The Soviets refused to support the development of Germany
  because they feared another German-initiated war.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the war, <b>Austria</b> and <b>Germany</b> were divided into
  <b>4</b> <b>military</b> <b>occupation</b> <b>zones</b>, each assigned to one
  of the Big Four powers (<b>France</b>, <b>Britain</b>, <b> America</b>, and
  the <b>USSR</b>).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Denied post-war economic support from America, the USSR wanted to take war
  reparations from Germany.
</p>
<p>
  As the USSR spread communism to its Eastern zone in Germany and the Western
  Allies promoted the idea of a reunited Germany, Germany was divided into 2
  zones.&nbsp; <b>West Germany</b> became an independent country, and
  <b> East Germany</b> became bound to the Soviet Union as an independent
  "satellite" state, shutoff from the Western world by the "<b>iron curtain</b>"
  of the Soviet Union.
</p>
<p>
  Berlin, still occupied by the Four Big powers, was completely surrounded by
  the Soviet Occupation Zone.&nbsp; In <b>1948</b>, the Soviet Union attempted
  to starve the Allies out of Berlin by cutting off all rail and highway access
  to the city.&nbsp; In <b>May 1949</b>, after America had flown in many
  supplies, the <b>blockade</b> was lifted.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1949</b>, the <b>governments</b> of <b>East</b> and <b>West</b>
  <b>Germany</b> were established.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Cold War Congeals</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1946</b>, Stalin, seeking oil concessions, broke an agreement to remove
  his troops from <b>Iran's</b> northernmost province.&nbsp; He used the troops
  to aid a rebel movement.&nbsp; When Truman protested, Stalin backed down.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1947</b>, <u>George F. Kennan</u> came up with the "<b
    >containment doctrine</b
  >,"&nbsp;which tried to explain the behavior of the USSR. This concept stated
  that the USSR was relentlessly expansionary and that the USSR could be
  <strong>contained</strong> by being firm and vigilant.
</p>
<p>
  This doctrine was embraced by President Truman in 1947 when Congress passed
  the <b>Truman Doctrine</b>. This gave financial support to Greece to resist
  communist pressures. Truman declared that it must be the policy of the United
  States to aid any country that was resisting communist aggression.
</p>
<p>
  Following WWII, France, Italy, and Germany were suffering from the hunger and
  economic chaos caused by the war. They were in danger of being taken over by
  Communist parties within the countries. By promising financial aid, American
  Secretary of State <u>George C. Marshall</u> convinced the Europeans to create
  a <b>joint plan</b> for their economic recovery. Marshall offered the same aid
  to the Soviet Union and its allies, but the Soviets refused it. The
  <b>Marshall Plan</b> gave $12.5 billion to 16 European countries. Within a few
  years, Europe's economy was flourishing, and the Communist parties had lost
  ground.
</p>
<p>
  Access to <b>Middle</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>oil</b> was crucial to the European
  recovery program and to the health of the U.S. economy.&nbsp; Despite threats
  from the Arab nations to cut off the supply of oil, President Truman
  officially recognized the state of <b>Israel</b> on <b>May 14, 1948</b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>America Begins to Rearm</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>Cold War</b>, the struggle to contain Soviet communism, was not a war,
  but it was also not a peace.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1947</b>, Congress passed the <b>National Security Act</b>, creating the
  <b>Department of Defense</b>.&nbsp; The department was headed by a new cabinet
  officer, the <b>secretary of defense</b>. The heads of each branch of the
  military were brought together as the <b>Joint Chiefs of Staff</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The National Security Act also established the
  <b>National Security Council</b> (<b>NSC</b>) to advise the president on
  security matters, and it created the
  <b>Central Intelligence Agency</b> (<b>CIA</b>) to coordinate the government's
  foreign fact-gathering.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1948</b>, the United States joined the European pact, called the
  <b>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</b> (<b>NATO</b>).&nbsp; The pact
  pledged each nation to regard an attack on one as an attack on all. The pact
  also marked a departure from American diplomatic convention, a boost for
  European unification, and a significant step in the militarization of the Cold
  War.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reconstruction and Revolution in Asia</b></p>
<p>
  General <u>Douglas MacArthur</u> took control of the democratization of
  Japan.&nbsp; The Japanese people cooperated with his plans; they saw that good
  behavior and the adoption of democracy would speed the end of the
  occupation.&nbsp; In <b>1946</b>, a <b>MacArthur-dictated constitution</b> was
  adopted.&nbsp; It renounced militarism and introduced western-style democratic
  government.
</p>
<p>From 1946-1948, top Japanese "war criminals" were tried in Tokyo.</p>
<p>
  In late <b>1949</b>, the Chinese <b>Nationalist</b> government of
  <u> Generalissimo Jiang Jieshi</u> was forced to flee the country to the
  island of <b>Formosa</b> (<b>Taiwan</b>) when the <b>communists</b>, led by
  <u>Mao Zedong</u>, took over the country.&nbsp; The collapse of Nationalist
  China was a depressing loss for America and its allies in the Cold War, as ¼
  of the world's population fell to communism.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>September</b> <b>1949</b>, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> exploded its
  first <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b>, 3 years before experts thought
  possible.&nbsp; To stay one step ahead, Truman ordered the development of the
  <b> H-bomb</b> (<b>Hydrogen Bomb</b>).&nbsp; The first H-bomb was exploded in
  <b>1952</b>.&nbsp; The Soviets exploded their first H-bomb in <b>1953</b>, and
  the nuclear arms race entered a dangerously competitive cycle.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Ferreting Out Alleged Communists</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1947</b>, President Truman launched the <b>Loyalty Review Board</b> to
  investigate the possibility of communist spies in the government.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1949</b>, 11 communists were sent to prison for violating the
  <b>Smith Act of 1940</b> (first peacetime antisedition law since 1798) in
  supporting the overthrow of the American government.&nbsp; The ruling was
  upheld in <b><i>Dennis v. United States</i></b> (<b>1951</b>).
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1938</b>, the House of Representatives established the
  <b>Committee on Un-American Activities</b> (<b>HUAC</b>) to investigate
  "subversion" (opposition to the government).&nbsp; In <b>1948</b>, Congressman
  <u>Richard M. Nixon</u> led the conviction of <u>Alger Hiss</u>, a prominent
  ex-New Dealer. Americans began to join in on the hunt for communist spies who
  were thought to be living in America.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1950</b>, Truman vetoed the <b>McCarran Internal Security Bill</b>,
  which authorized the president to arrest and detain suspicious people during
  an "internal security emergency."&nbsp; Congress overrode Truman's veto and
  passed the bill.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1951</b>, <u>Julius and Ethel Rosenberg</u> were convicted and sentenced
  to death for stealing American atomic bomb plans and selling them to the
  Soviet Union.&nbsp; They were the only people in history to be sentenced to
  death for espionage.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Democratic Divisions in 1948</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1948</b>, the <b>Republicans</b> chose <u>Thomas E. Dewey</u> to run for
  president.&nbsp; After war hero <u>Dwight D. Eisenhower</u> chose not to run
  for the presidency, the <b>Democrats</b> chose <u>Truman</u>. Truman's
  nomination split the Democratic Party.&nbsp; <b>Southern</b> <b>Democrats</b>
  opposed Truman because he supported civil rights for blacks, so they nominated
  <u>Governor J. Strom Thurmond</u>. The new
  <strong>Progressive party</strong> nominated <u>Henry A. Wallace</u>.&nbsp;
  <strong>Truman</strong> won and was <b>reelected</b>
  <b>as president</b>.&nbsp; Truman's victory came from the votes of farmers,
  workers, and blacks.
</p>
<p>
  President Truman supported a plan to lend American money to underdeveloped
  countries ("<b>bold new program</b>" or "<b>Point Four</b>" program). He
  wanted to help these countries develop before they succumbed to communism.
</p>
<p>
  At home, Truman supported a "<b>Fair Deal</b>" program in <b> 1949</b>. It
  called for improved housing, full employment, a higher minimum wage, better
  farm price supports, new TVAs, and an extension of Social Security.&nbsp;
  Congress only passed parts of the program: raises to the minimum wage;
  creation of public housing in the <b>Housing Act of 1949;</b> extension of
  old-age insurance to many more beneficiaries in the
  <b>Social Security Act of 1950</b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Korean Volcano Erupts</b></p>
<p>
  When Japan collapsed in 1945, <b>Korea</b> was divided up into two
  sections:&nbsp; the Soviets controlled the north above the
  <b>38<sup>th</sup> parallel</b> and the United States controlled south of that
  line. Each country set up opposing governments in Korea.
</p>
<p>
  The
  <strong>National Security Council Memorandum Number 68</strong>
  (<strong>NSC-68</strong>) was a document created by the National Security
  Council that outlined America's national security strategy. It called for
  quadrupling military spending and using the Containment policy in regards to
  the Soviet Union. <b>NSC-68</b> was a <b>key</b> <b>document</b> of the Cold
  War because it marked a major step in the militarization of American foreign
  policy.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>June 25, 1950</b>, the North Korean army invaded South Korea.&nbsp;In
  response to this, Truman ordered a massive military buildup, well beyond what
  was necessary for the <b>Korean War</b>. Without Congress's approval, Truman
  ordered American air and naval units to be sent to support South Korea. The
  U.N. was responsible for sending troops to fight the North Koreans, but the
  fight was led by <u>General MacArthur</u> and most of the troops were
  American.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Military Seesaw in Korea</b></p>
<p>
  On September 15, 1950, <u>General MacArthur</u> pushed the North Koreans past
  the <b>38<sup>th</sup> parallel</b>, but on<b> November</b> <b>1950</b>,
  thousands of <b>communist</b> <b>Chinese</b> "<b>volunteers</b>" attacked the
  U.N. forces, pushing them back to the 38<sup>th</sup> parallel.
</p>
<p>
  Due to General MacArthur's insubordination and disagreement with the Joint
  Chiefs of Staff about increasing the size of the war, President Truman was
  removed MacArthur from command on <b>April 11, 1951</b>.
</p>
<p>
  In July 1951, truce discussions dragged out over the issue of prisoner
  exchange.

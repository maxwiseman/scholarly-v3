<h3>Chapter 33</h3>
<h4>The Great Depression and the New Deal</h4>
<h4>1933-1939</h4>
<hr />
<p>
  The Republicans nominated <u>Herbert Hoover</u> to run for president in the
  election of 1932.&nbsp; The Democrats chose
  <u>Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR)</u>.&nbsp; He had been born to a wealthy
  New York family and served as the governor of New York.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>FDR:&nbsp; Politician in a Wheelchair</b></p>
<p>
  FDR's wife, <u>Eleanor Roosevelt</u>, was very active her husband's political
  career. She was loved by liberals and hated by conservatives.
</p>
<p>
  FDR was a very good public speaker. In the election of 1932, the Democrats
  called for a balanced budget and social and economic reforms.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Presidential Hopefuls of 1932</b></p>
<p>
  During the election, FDR attacked the Republican Old Deal and supported a New
  Deal for the "forgotten man."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Many Americans distrusted the Republican party because of the dire economic
  state of the country (Great Depression). Herbert Hoover believed that the
  worst of the Depression was over. Hoover reaffirmed his faith in American free
  enterprise and individualism.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Hoover's Humiliation in 1932</b></p>
<p>
  <strong>Franklin Roosevelt won the election of 1932</strong> by a sweeping
  majority, in both the popular vote and the Electoral College.
</p>
<p>
  Beginning in the election of 1932, blacks became a vital part of the
  Democratic Party, especially in the urban centers of the North.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>FDR and the Three R's:&nbsp; Relief, Recovery, Reform</b></p>
<p>
  On March 6-10, President Roosevelt declared a national banking holiday as a
  prelude to opening the banks on a sounder basis.&nbsp; The
  <b> Hundred Days</b> <b>Congress/Emergency Congress</b> (March 9-June 16,
  1933)<b> </b>passed a series laws to help improve the state of the country.
  This Congress
</p>
<p>
  Congress also passed some of FDR's <b>New Deal</b> programs, which focused
  on:&nbsp; <b>relief</b>, <b>recovery</b>, <b>reform</b>. Short-range goals
  were relief and immediate recovery, and long-range goals were permanent
  recovery and reform. Some of the New Deal programs gave the President
  unprecedented powers, which included the
  <strong>ability of the President to create legislation</strong>. Many of the
  programs that gave the President this authority were declared unconstitutional
  by the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>
  Congress gave President Roosevelt extraordinary
  <b> blank-check powers</b>:&nbsp; some of the laws gave legislative authority
  to the President.
</p>
<p>
  The New Deal legislation embraced <b>progressive</b> <b>ideas</b> like
  unemployment insurance, old-age insurance, minimum-wage regulations,
  conservation and development of natural resources, and restrictions on child
  labor.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Roosevelt Manages the Money</b></p>
<p>
  Congress passed the <b> Emergency Banking Relief Act of 1933</b>, which gave
  the President power to regulate banking transactions and foreign exchange and
  to reopen solvent banks.
</p>
<p>
  President Roosevelt gave "<strong>fireside chats</strong>" over the radio in
  which he soothed the public's confidence in banks.
</p>
<p>
  Congress created the
  <b>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation </b>(<b>FDIC</b>) with the
  <b>Glass-Steagall Banking Reform Act</b>. The FDIC insured individual bank
  deposits up to $5,000. This ended nation's epidemic of bank failures.
</p>
<p>
  President Roosevelt took the nation off of the gold standard by having the
  Treasury buy gold from citizens. From this point on, only transactions in
  paper money were accepted.
</p>
<p>
  One of the FDR's goals was to create modest <b>inflation</b>. This would
  relieve debtors' burdens and stimulate new production. Inflation was achieved
  by buying gold at increasing prices over time. This policy increased the
  amount of dollars in circulation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Creating Jobs for the Jobless</b></p>
<p>FDR created jobs with federal money to jumpstart the economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  The <b>Civilian Conservation Corps</b> (<b>CCC</b>) employed about 3 million
  men in government camps.&nbsp; Their work included reforestation, fire
  fighting, flood control, and swamp drainage.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Federal Emergency Relief Act</b> was Congress's first major effort to
  deal with the massive unemployment. It created the<b>
    Federal Emergency Relief Administration</b
  >
  (<b>FERA</b>) which gave states direct relief payments or money for wages on
  work projects.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Civil Works</b> <b>Administration</b> (<b>CWA</b>), a branch of the
  FERA, was designed to provide temporary jobs during the winter
  emergency.&nbsp; Thousands of unemployed were employed at leaf raking and
  other manual-labor jobs.
</p>
<p>
  Relief was given to the farmers with the
  <b>Agricultural Adjustment Act</b> (<b>AAA</b>), making available millions of
  dollars to help farmers meet their mortgages.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Home Owners' Loan Corporation</b> (<b>HOLC</b>) assisted many
  households that had trouble paying their mortgages.

<p><b>A Day for Every Demagogue</b></p>
<p>
  Despite New Deal efforts, unemployment continued to plague the nation.
  Opponents to FDR's policies included <u>Father Charles Coughlin's</u>, who
  preached anti-New Deal speeches over the radio.&nbsp; Senator
  <u>Huey P. Long</u> publicized his "Share Our Wealth" program in which every
  family in the United States would receive $5,000.&nbsp;
  <u>Dr. Francis E. Townsend</u> attracted millions of senior citizens with his
  plan that each citizen over the age of 60 would receive $200 a month.
</p>
<p>
  Congress passed the <b>Works Progress Administration</b> (<b>WPA</b>) in
  <b>1935</b>, with the objective of providing employment for useful projects
  (i.e. the construction of buildings, roads, etc.).&nbsp; Taxpayers criticized
  the agency for paying people to do "useless" jobs such as painting murals.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New Visibility for Women</strong></p>
<p>
  Women began to break gender barriers by holding positions in the Federal
  government, including the President's cabinet.
</p>
<p><u>Ruth Benedict</u>: made strides in the field of anthropology</p>
<p>
  <u>Pearl Buck</u>: wrote about Chinese peasant society; won a Nobel Prize in
  literature in 1938.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> Helping Industry and Labor</b></p>
<p>
  A cornerstone New Deal agency was the
  <b>National Recovery Administration</b> (<b>NRA</b>). It was designed to bring
  industries together to create a set of "fair" business practices (fair to
  business and workers). Working hours were reduced so that more people could be
  hired; a minimum wage was established; workers were given the right to
  organize.
</p>
<p>
  The NRA was declared <strong>unconstitutional</strong> by the Supreme Court in
  <b>1935</b> (<b><i>Schechter vs. United States</i></b
  >), because the NRA gave legislative powers to the President, and it allowed
  Congress to control individual business, not just interstate commerce.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Public Works Administration</b> (<b>PWA</b>) was intended to provide
  long-term recovery.&nbsp; Headed by <u> Harold L. Ickes</u>, the agency spent
  over $4 billion on thousands of projects, including public buildings,
  highways, and dams.
</p>
<p>
  Congress repealed prohibition with the <b>21<sup>st</sup> Amendment</b> in
  late <b>1933</b> to raise federal revenue and provide employment,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Paying Farmers Not to Farm</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>Agricultural Adjustment Administration</b> (<b>AAA</b>) attempted to
  reduce crop surpluses, which led to lower crop prices. The AAA established
  standard "<b>parity prices</b>" for basic commodities. The agency also paid
  farmers to not farm (to reduce their crop harvests).
</p>
<p>
  The Supreme Court ruled the AAA <strong>unconstitutional</strong> in
  <b>1936</b>, stating that its taxation programs were illegal.
</p>
<p>
  In a second attempt to make farmers farm less, Congress passed the
  <b>Soil Conservation </b> and<b> Domestic Allotment Act of 1936</b
  >.&nbsp;Under the guise of conservation, it reduced crop acreage by paying
  farmers to plant soil-conserving crops.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Second Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938</b> continued conservation
  payments; if farmers obeyed acreage restrictions on specific commodities, they
  would be eligible for payments.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Dust Bowls and Black Blizzards</b></p>
<p>
  Late in <b>1933</b>, the <b>Dust Bowl</b> struck many states in the
  trans-Mississippi Great Plains.&nbsp;It was caused by drought, wind, and
  <strong>over-farming</strong> of the land.
</p>
<p>
  The <b> Frazier-Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act</b>, passed in <b>1934</b>,
  suspended mortgage foreclosures on farms for 5 years. It was struck down in
  <b> 1935</b> by the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1935</b>, the <b> Resettlement Administration</b>, moved near-farmless
  farmers to better lands.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Indian Reorganization Act of 1934</b> encouraged Native American tribes
  to establish self-government and to preserve their native crafts and
  traditions.&nbsp; 77 tribes refused to organize under the law, while hundreds
  did organize.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Battling Bankers and Big Business</b></p>
<p>
  To protect the public against investment fraud, Congress passed the "Truth in
  Securities Act" (<b>Federal Securities Act</b>). It required people selling
  investments to inform their investors of the risks of the investment.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Securities and Exchange Commission</b> (<b>SEC</b>) was created in
  1934. It provided oversight of the stock market.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>TVA Harnesses the Tennessee</b></p>
<p>
  New Dealers accused the electric-power industry of charging the public too
  much money for electricity.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1933</b>, the Hundred Days Congress created the
  <b> Tennessee Valley Authority</b> (<b>TVA</b>).&nbsp; It was designed to
  construct dams on the Tennessee River. In addition to providing employment and
  long-term recovery, these projects would give the government information on
  exactly how much money was required to produce and distribute electricity.
  This would be a metric that the government could use to assess the rates
  charged by private companies.
</p>
<p>
  The TVA turned a poverty-stricken area into one of the most flourishing
  regions in the United States.
</p>
<p>
  Conservatives viewed the New Deal programs as "<strong>socialistic</strong>",
  and they ultimately helped limit the TVA-style of management to the Tennessee
  Valley.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Housing and Social Security</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>Federal Housing Administration</b> (<b>FHA</b>), passed in <b>1934</b>,
  attempted to improve the home-building industry. It gave small loans to
  homeowners for the purpose of improving their homes and buying new ones.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>United States Housing Authority</b> (<b>USHA</b>) was passed in
  <b>1937</b>. It was designed to lend money to states or communities for
  low-cost housing developments.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Social Security Act of 1935</b> provided federal-state unemployment
  insurance. To provide security for old age, specified categories of retired
  workers were to receive regular payments from Washington. Social Security was
  inspired by the example of some of the more highly industrialized nations of
  Europe.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>purpose of Social Security</strong> was to provide<strong>
    support for urbanized Americans</strong
  >
  who could not support themselves with a farm. In the past, Americans could
  support themselves by growing food on their farm. Now, they relied solely on
  money from their job. If they lost their job, they could not eat.
</p>
<p>Republicans opposed Social Security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A New Deal Labor</b></p>
<p>
  Congress passed the <b> National Labor Relations Act of 1935 </b>(<b
    >Wagner Act</b
  >) to help labor unions.&nbsp; This law created a powerful
  <b>National Labor Relations Board</b> for administrative purposes and it
  reasserted the rights of labor to engage in self-organization and to bargain
  collectively through representatives of its own choice.
</p>
<p>
  Unskilled workers began to organize under leadership from<u> John L. Lewis</u
  >, boss of the United Mine Workers.&nbsp; He formed the
  <b>Committee for Industrial Organization</b> (<b>CIO</b>) in
  <b>1935</b>.&nbsp; The CIO led a series of strikes, including the sit-down
  strike at the General Motors automobile factory in 1936.
</p>
<p>
  Congress passed the <b>Fair Labor Standards Act</b> (<b
    >Wages and Hours Bill</b
  >) in <b>1938</b>.&nbsp; Industries involved in interstate commerce were to
  set up minimum-wage and maximum-hour levels.&nbsp; Labor by children under the
  age of 16 was forbidden.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1938</b>, the CIO joined with the AF of L and the name "<i>Committee</i>
  for Industrial Organization" was changed to "<b
    ><i>Congress</i> of Industrial Organization<i>s</i></b
  >." The CIO was led by John Lewis.&nbsp; By 1940, the CIO claimed about 4
  million members.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Landon Challenges "the Champ"</b></p>
<p>
  The Republicans chose <u>Alfred M. Landon</u> to run against President
  Roosevelt in the election of 1936. The Republicans condemned the New Deal for
  its radicalism, experimentation, confusion, and "frightful waste."
</p>
<p>
  Democrats had significant support from the millions of people that had
  benefited from the New Deal programs.
</p>
<p>
  President Roosevelt was <b>reelected</b> as president in a lopsided
  victory.&nbsp; FDR won primarily because he had appealed to the "forgotten
  man" (the South, blacks, urbanites, the poor).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Nine Old Men on the Bench</b></p>
<p>
  Ratified in <b>1933</b>, the <b>20<sup>th</sup> Amendment</b> shortened the
  period from election to inauguration by 6 weeks.
</p>
<p>
  Roosevelt saw his reelection as a mandate to continue the New Deal reforms.
</p>
<p>
  The Supreme Court was dominated by older ultraconservatives who attempted to
  stop many of the "socialistic" New Deal programs.
</p>
<p>
  With continous Democrat wins in Congress and the presidency, Roosevelt felt
  that the American people wanted the New Deal. He argued that the Supreme Court
  needed to get in line with public opinion. In 1937, Roosevelt proposed
  legislation that would allow him to add liberal justices to the Court: a new
  justice would be added for every member over the age of 70 who would not
  retire. The plan received much negative feedback. The plan was referred to as
  the <strong>Court-packing plan</strong>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Court Changes Course</b></p>
<p>
  The public criticized Roosevelt for attempting to tamper with the Supreme
  Court. This was an affront on the system of checks and balances.
</p>
<p>
  Possibly to due public pressure, the Supreme Court began to support New Deal
  legislation. This included Justice <u>Owen J. Roberts</u>, who was formerly
  regarded as a conservative.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  A series of deaths and resignations of justices allowed Roosevelt to appoint 9
  justices to the Court.
</p>
<p>
  The Supreme Court controversy in 1937 cost FDR a lot of political capital.
  Because of this, few New Deal reforms were passed after 1937.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Twilight of the New Deal</b></p>
<p>
  In Roosevelt's first term, from 1933-1937, unemployment still ran high and
  recovery had been slow.&nbsp; In <b>1937</b>, the <b> economy</b> took another
  <b>downturn. </b> It was caused by <strong>reduced spending</strong>. Consumer
  spending was reduced because Social Security taxes cut into payrolls. The
  Roosevelt administration also cut back on spending in an attempt to keep a
  balanced budget. (The New Deal had run deficits for several years, but all of
  them had been somewhat small and none was intended.)
</p>
<p>
  The downturn led FDR to embrace the recommendations of the British economist
  <u>John Maynard Keynes</u>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Keynesianism Economics</strong>: government money is used to "prime
  the pump" of the economy and encourage consumer spending; this policy
  intentionally creates a budget deficit.
</p>
<p>
  Congress passed the <b>Hatch Act of 1939</b>. It prevented federal
  administrative officials from active political campaigning and soliciting. It
  also forbade the use of government funds for political purposes as well as the
  collection of campaign contributions from people receiving relief payments.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>New Deal or Raw Deal?</b></p>
<p>
  Opponents of the New Deal charged the President of spending too much money on
  his programs, significantly increasing the <b>national debt</b>. From 1932 to
  1939, the national debt increased from $19 trillion to $40 trillion.
</p>
<p>The Federal government became much more powerful under FDR.</p>
<p>
  The New Deal did not end the depression; it just gave temporary relief to
  citizens.&nbsp;Many economists eventually argued that not enough deficit
  spending was used. Despite the New Deal programs' efforts,
  <strong>production still outpaced spending</strong>.
</p>
<p>Not until World War II was the unemployment problem solved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>FDR's Balance Sheet</b></p>
<p>
  New Deal supporters had argued out that relief, not the economy, was the
  primary objective of their war on the Depression.&nbsp; Roosevelt believed
  that the government was morally bound to prevent mass hunger and starvation by
  "managing" the economy.
</p>
<p>
  FDR potentially saved capitalism by eliminating some of its worst faults (ex:
  poor labor conditions). Had his programs not been implemented, Socialism
  could've taken a bigger hold in the nation.
</p>
<p>
  FDR was a Hamiltonian in that he supported big government, but he was a
  Jeffersonian in that he supported the "forgotten man."

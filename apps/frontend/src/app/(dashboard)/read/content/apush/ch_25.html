<p>Chapter 25</p>
<p>America Moves to the City</p>
<p>1865-1900</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 1870-1900, the population of American cities had tripled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Urban Frontier</b></p>
<p>By 1890, New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia all had populations greater than 1 million.</p>
<p><u>Louis Sullivan</u> contributed to the development of the 
  skyscraper.&nbsp; City limits were extended outward by electric trolleys.&nbsp; People 
  were attracted to cities by amenities like electricity, indoor plumbing, 
  and telephones.</p>
<p>Trash became a large problem in cities due to throwaway 
bottles, boxes, bags, and cans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The New Immigration</b></p>
<p>The <strong>New Immigrants</strong> of the 1880s came from southern 
  and eastern Europe.&nbsp; They came from countries with little history of democratic 
  government, where people had grown accustomed to harsh living conditions.</p>
<p>Some Americans feared that the New Immigrants would not <strong> assimilate</strong> into American culture. They began asking if the nation had 
  become a melting pot or a dumping ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Southern Europe Uprooted</b></p>
<p>Immigrants left their native countries because Europe had 
no room for them.&nbsp; The population of Europe nearly doubled in the century after 
1800 due to abundant supplies of fish and grain from America and the widespread 
cultivation of Europe.</p>
<p>"<b>America fever</b>" caught on in Europe as the United 
States was portrayed as a land of great opportunities.</p>
<p>Persecutions of minorities in Europe sent many immigrants to the United States.&nbsp; Many immigrants never intended to stay in 
  America forever; a large number returned home with money.&nbsp; Those immigrants who 
  stayed in the United States struggled to preserve their traditional culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reactions to the New Immigration</b></p>
<p>The federal government did little to help immigrants assimilate into American society.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Community "<strong>bosses</strong>" took care of immigrants by providing jobs, housing, schools, parks, and hospitals. In return, immigrants voted for these bosses. </p>
<p>Americans gradually became aware of the 
  troubles of cities.&nbsp; <u>Walter Rauschenbusch</u> and <u>Washington Gladden</u> were Protestant clergymen who sought to apply the lessons of Christianity to the 
  slums and factories.</p>
<p><strong>Settlement House</strong>: a house located in a poor, urban area where middle-class people would live and take care of the local community by providing services like healthcare and daycare;&nbsp;became centers of women's activism and of social reform.</p>
<p><u>Jane Addams</u> established <strong>Hull House</strong>, the most 
  prominent American settlement house.&nbsp; Addams condemned war and poverty.&nbsp; 
  Hull House offered instruction in English, counselling to help immigrants deal 
  with American big-city life, childcare services for working mothers, and 
  cultural activities for neighborhood residents.&nbsp; </p>
<p><u>Lillian Wald</u> established <b>Henry Street Settlement</b> 
in New York in <b>1893</b>.</p>
<p><u>Florence Kelley</u> was a lifelong supporter for the 
  welfare of women, children, blacks, and consumers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Addams, Wald, and Kelley paved the way for future women to enter the profession of social work.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Narrowing the Welcome Mat</b></p>
<p><strong>Antiforeignism</strong>, or <strong>nativism</strong>, arose in the 
  1880s.&nbsp;Nativists worried that the original Anglo-Saxon population would soon be outnumbered and outvoted, and they blamed immigrants for societal problems.</p>
<p>An antiforeigner organization was the <strong> American Protective Association </strong>(APA). &nbsp;It was created in <strong>1887</strong> and it urged to 
  vote against Roman Catholic candidates for office.</p>
<p>In <strong>1882</strong>, Congress passed the first restrictive law 
  against immigrants.&nbsp; It forced criminals and convicts back to their 
  home countries.&nbsp; In <strong>1885</strong>, Congress banned the importation of foreign 
  workers under contract; they were usually contracted for substandard wages. Literacy tests began in 1917. </p>
<p>In <strong>1882</strong>, Congress barred the Chinese from 
  immigrating to the United States (<strong>Chinese Exclusion Act</strong>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Churches Confront the Urban Challenge</b></p>
<p><strong>Protestant</strong> churches suffered from people moving to the cities.</p>
<p><u>Dwight Lyman Moody</u>, a Protestant evangelist, preached about kindness and forgiveness.&nbsp; He contributed to adapting the 
  old-time religion to the facts of city life.&nbsp; The <strong>Moody Bible Institute</strong> was founded in Chicago in <strong>1889</strong> to carry out his work.</p>
<p><b>Roman Catholic</b> and <b>Jewish</b> faiths were gaining 
enormous strength from the New Immigration.</p>
<p>By <b>1890</b>, there were over 150 religious denominations 
in the United States.</p>
<p>The <strong>Church of Christ, Scientist</strong> was founded in <strong> 1879</strong> by <u>Mary Baker Eddy,</u> who preached that the true practice of 
  Christianity heals sickness.</p>

<p><b>Darwin Disrupts the Churches</b></p>
<p>Published in <b>1859</b> by <u>Charles Darwin</u>, <b><i>On 
the Origin of the Species</i></b> stated that humans had slowly evolved from 
lower forms of life.</p>
<p>The theory of evolution cast serious doubt on the idea of 
  religion.&nbsp; <strong>Conservatives</strong> stood by their beliefs of God and 
  religion, while <strong>Modernists</strong> flatly refused to accept the Bible in its 
  entirety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Lust for Learning</b></p>
<p>During this time period, public education and the idea of 
  tax-supported elementary schools and high schools gained support.</p>
<p>Teacher-training schools, called "<b>normal schools</b>", 
experienced great expansion after the Civil War.</p>
<p>The New Immigration in the 1880s and 1890s brought new 
  strength to the private Catholic parochial schools, which were becoming a 
  major part of the nation's educational structure.</p>
<p>Public schools excluded millions of adults.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Crowded cities 
  generally provided better educational facilities than the old one-room rural 
  schoolhouses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Booker T. Washington and Education for Black People</b></p>
<p>The South lagged far behind other regions in public 
  education. African-Americans suffered the most.</p>
<p>The leading champion of black education was ex-slave <u> Booker T. Washington</u>.&nbsp; He taught in <strong>1881</strong> at the black normal and 
  industrial school at Tuskegee, Alabama.&nbsp; His self-help approach to solving the 
  nation's racial problems was labeled "<strong>accommodationist</strong>" because it 
  did not directly challenge white supremacy.&nbsp; Washington avoided the 
  issue of <em>social</em> equality, focusing on <em>economic</em> equality.</p>
<p><u>George Washington Carver</u> taught and researched at <b>
Tuskegee</b> <b>Institute</b> in <b>1896</b>.&nbsp; He became an internationally 
famous agricultural chemist.</p>
<p>Black leaders, including <u>Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois</u>, 
attacked Booker T. Washington because Washington condemned the black race to 
manual labor and perpetual inferiority.&nbsp; Du Bois helped to form the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (<b>NAACP</b>) in <b>1910</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Hallowed Halls of Ivy</b></p>
<p>Female and black colleges arose after the Civil War.</p>
<p>The <strong>Morrill</strong> <strong>Act</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>1862 </strong>granted public 
  lands to the states to support education. <strong>Land-grant colleges</strong> formed out of these grants.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hatch Act of</strong> <strong>1887</strong> extended the Morrill 
  Act and provided federal funds for the establishment of agricultural experiment 
  stations in connection with the land-grant colleges.</p>
<p>Millionaires and tycoons donated generously to the 
educational system.</p>
<p><strong>Johns Hopkins University</strong>, founded in <strong>1876</strong>, 
  had the nation's first high-grade graduate school.</p>

  moderate tariff.</p>
<p><u>Henry George</u> wrote the 
  book <strong><em>Progress and </em>Poverty</strong> in <strong>1879</strong>, which addressed the association of progress with poverty. &nbsp;He proposed a 100 percent tax on profits due to increased land value.</p>
<p><u>Edward Bellamy</u> wrote the socialistic novel, <strong><em> Looking Backward.</em></strong> The book portrayed a time in the future when big 
  businesses are nationalized to serve the public interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Families and Women in the City</b></p>
<p>Starting in the late 1800s, divorce rates increased and family sizes decreased.</p>
<p>Women became more independent in the urban 
  environment.&nbsp; Feminist <u>Charlotte Perkins Gilman</u> called upon women to 
  abandon their dependent status and contribute to the larger life of the 
  community through productive involvement in the economy.</p>
<p>In <b>1890</b>, the <b>National American Woman Suffrage 
Association</b> was founded.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The re-born suffrage movement and other women's 
organization excluded black women.</p>
<p><u>Ida B. Wells</u> helped launch the black women's club 
  movement, which led to the establishment of the <strong>National Association of 
    Colored Women</strong> in <strong>1896</strong>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prohibiting Alcohol and Promoting Reform</strong></p>
<p>Liquor consumption increased during the late 1800s.</p>

  The <strong>Woman's Christian Temperance Union</strong> was created in <strong>1874</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Anti-Saloon League</strong> convinced states to band the sale of alcohol. In <strong>1919</strong>, the <strong>18<sup>th </sup></strong>&nbsp;<strong>Amendment</strong> banned alcohol in America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

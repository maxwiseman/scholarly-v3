<p class="MsoNormal">Chapter 22</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Ordeal of Reconstruction</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1865-1877</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Problems of Peace</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All rebel (Confederate) leaders were pardoned by President 
  Johnson in 1868. After the war, Southern people continued to believe that their view of secession was correct.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Freedmen Define Freedom</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Emancipation took effect unevenly in different parts of the 
conquered Confederacy.&nbsp; Some slaves resisted the liberating Union armies due to 
their loyalty to their masters.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The church became the focus of black community life in the 
  years following emancipation.&nbsp; Blacks formed their own churches pastured by 
  their own ministers, and they had an opportunity for education. Blacks could now learn to read and 
  write.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Freedmen's Bureau</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because many freedmen (people who were freed from slavery) 
  were unskilled, without property or money, and had little knowledge 
  of how to survive as free people, Congress created the <strong>Freedmen's Bureau </strong> on March 3,<strong> 1865</strong>.&nbsp; It provided clothing, medical care, 
  food, and education to both freedmen and white refugees.&nbsp; Union general <u> Oliver O. Howard</u> led the bureau.&nbsp; The bureau's greatest success was teaching 
  blacks to read.&nbsp; Because it was despised by the President and by Southerners, 
  the<strong> </strong>Freedmen's Bureau expired in <strong>1872</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Johnson: The Tailor President</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When <u>Andrew Johnson</u> was in Congress, he refused 
  to secede with his own state of Tennessee.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Johnson was listed as the Vice President on Lincoln's 1864 election ticket to gain support from the War Democrats and other 
  pro-Southern elements.&nbsp; Johnson was a strong supporter of state's rights and of 
  the Constitution. &nbsp;He was a Southerner who did not understand the North and a 
  Democrat who had not been accepted by the Republicans.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Presidential Reconstruction</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In <strong>1863</strong>, Lincoln released his "<strong>10 percent</strong>" <strong> Reconstruction</strong> <strong>plan</strong> which dictated that a state could be reintegrated 
  into the Union when 10% of its voters in the presidential election of 1860 had 
  taken an oath of allegiance to the United States and pledged to abide by 
  emancipation.&nbsp; Then, a formal state government would be constructed within the 
  state, and the state would be re-admitted into the Union.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Due to Republican fears over the restoration of planter 
aristocracy and the possible re-enslavement of blacks, Congress passed the <b>
Wade-Davis Bill </b>in <b>1864</b>.&nbsp; It required that 50% of a state's voters 
take the oath of allegiance and it demanded stronger safeguards for 
emancipation.&nbsp; President Lincoln refused to sign the bill.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The disagreement between the President and Congress 
  revealed differences in Republicans and <strong>two factions</strong> arose within the party:&nbsp; a <strong> majority</strong> that agreed with Lincoln and believed that the seceded states 
  should be restored to the Union as quickly as possible, and a radical <strong> minority</strong> that felt the South should suffer greatly before its re-admittance 
  - this minority wanted the South's social structure to be uprooted, the planters 
  to be punished, and the newly-emancipated blacks to be protected by federal power.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>President Johnson</u> issued his own <strong>Reconstruction 
  plan</strong> on May 29, <strong>1865</strong>.&nbsp; It called for special state conventions which 
  were required to: &nbsp;repeal the decrees of secession, repudiate all Confederate 
  debts, and ratify the slave-freeing <strong>13<sup>th</sup> Amendment</strong>. States that agreed to these concessions would be re-admitted.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Baleful Black Codes</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Black Codes</strong> was a series of laws designed to 
  regulate the affairs of the emancipated slaves.&nbsp; <strong>Mississippi</strong> passed the 
  first such law in November <strong>1865</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Black Codes aimed to ensure a stable and subservient 
labor force.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Blacks were forced to continue to work the plantations 
after their emancipation due to the system of "<b>sharecropping</b>."&nbsp; 
Plantation owners would rent out pieces of their land to blacks and make the 
cost of rent higher than the return the land produced.&nbsp; The renters of the land 
were bound by contract to continue to work the land until debts were repaid to 
the plantation owner.&nbsp; Unable to repay the debts, blacks began to "jump" their 
contracts.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The codes imposed harsh penalties on blacks who "jumped" 
their labor contracts, some of which usually forced the blacks to work for the 
same employer for one year.&nbsp; The codes also sought to restore the 
pre-emancipation system of race relations.&nbsp; The codes forbade a black to serve 
on a jury or to vote.&nbsp; The Black Codes mocked the idea of freedom and imposed 
terrible hardships on the blacks who were struggling against mistreatment and 
poverty to make their way as free people.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Republicans were strongly opposed to the Black Codes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Congressional Reconstruction</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In December <b>1865</b>, Southern states represented 
themselves in Congress with former Confederate generals and colonels.&nbsp; This 
infuriated the Republicans who were apprehensive about embracing their 
Confederate enemies in Congress.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Republicans had enjoyed their supreme rule in Congress 
  during the Civil War, but now there would be an opposing party.&nbsp; 
  This time, the South would have much more control in Congress due to the fact 
  that slaves were now counted as a whole person, not just 3/5. (This gave the South a 
  larger population.) &nbsp;Republicans feared that the South would take control of 
  Congress. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>President Johnson</u> announced on <strong>December 6, 1865</strong> that the Southern states had met his conditions and that the Union was now 
  restored. This statement angered the Republicans.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Johnson Clashes with Congress</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In <strong>February 1866</strong>, the president vetoed a bill extending the controversial Freedmen's Bureau (later re-passed). &nbsp;In response to this, Congress (controlled by 
  the Republicans) passed the <strong>Civil Rights Bill</strong> in March<strong> 1866</strong>, which 
  gave blacks the privilege of American citizenship and struck at the Black 
  Codes. Congress overruled the President's veto for this bill.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fearing that the Southerners might someday repeal the Civil Rights Law, Congress passed the <strong>14<sup>th</sup></strong> <strong>Amendment</strong> in <strong>1866</strong>.&nbsp; The amendment had the following components: &nbsp;1) Gave civil rights, including citizenship, to 
  the freedmen; 2) Reduced proportionately the representation of a state in 
  Congress and in the Electoral College if it denied blacks the right to vote; 3) Disqualified from federal and state offices former Confederates who, as federal 
  officeholders, had once sworn to support the Constitution of the United States; 4) Guaranteed the federal debt, while the Union assumed all Confederate 
  debts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the ability to overrule a presidential veto, Congress began to develop into the dominant role in 
  controlling the government.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All Republicans agreed that no state should be welcomed 
back into the Union without ratifying the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Swinging 'Round the Circle with Johnson</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In anticipation of the congressional elections of 1866, President Johnson went on a tour of giving speeches 
  denouncing the radical Republicans in Congress. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Over 2/3 of the ballots cast in the <strong>congressional 
  elections of 1866</strong> went to the Republicans.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Republicans Principles and Programs</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Charles Sumner</u> led the Republican radicals in the 
Senate for black freedom and racial equality.&nbsp; <u>Thaddeus Stevens</u> led the 
radicals in the House of Representatives.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The moderate Republicans, the majority in Congress, 
preferred policies that restrained the states from cutting citizens' rights, 
rather than policies that directly involved the federal government in individual 
lives. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reconstruction by the Sword</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On <strong>March 2, 1867</strong>, Congress passed the <strong> Reconstruction Act</strong>.&nbsp; It divided the South into <strong>5 military districts</strong>, 
  each commanded by a Union general and policed by Union soldiers.&nbsp; It also 
  required that states wishing to be re-admitted into the Union had to ratify the 
  14<sup>th</sup> Amendment, and that states' constitutions allowed former 
  adult male slaves to vote.&nbsp; The moderate Republican goal was to create voters in 
  Southern states that would vote those states back into the Union and thus free 
  the federal government from direct responsibility for the protection of black 
  rights.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <b>15<sup>th</sup></b> <b>Amendment</b> was passed by 
Congress in <b>1869</b>.&nbsp; It granted black men the right to vote.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Military Reconstruction</strong> of the South took control of 
  certain functions of the president and it set up a 
  military rule of the South.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In <strong>1877</strong>, the last federal troops were removed from 
  the South and Democracy returned to the South (in theory).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>No Women Voters</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Feminists were angered that the 13<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup>, 
and 15<sup>th</sup> Amendments gave rights to black males, but not to women.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Realities of Radical Reconstruction in the South</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After gaining the right to vote from the 15<sup>th</sup> Amendment, blacks began to organize politically.&nbsp; They were strong participators 
  in the <strong>Union League</strong>, originally a pro-Union organization.&nbsp; Freedmen 
  turned the Union League into a network of political clubs that educated members 
  and campaigned for Republican candidates.&nbsp; The League also built black churches and schools, represented black grievances before local employers 
  and governments, and recruited militias to protect black communities from white 
  retaliation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From 1868-1876, blacks began to hold major offices in 
  government.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"<b>Scalawags</b>" were Southerners who were accused of 
plundering the treasuries of the Southern states through their political 
influence in the radical governments.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"<b>Carpetbaggers</b>" were sleazy Northerners who had come 
to the South to seek power and profit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Ku Klux Klan</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The "<b>Invisible Empire of the South</b>", otherwise known 
as the <b>Ku Klux Klan</b>, was founded in Tennessee in <b>1866</b>.&nbsp; It was 
formed by disgruntled white Southerners who were angered by the success of black 
legislators.&nbsp; The group worked through intimidation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Congress passed the <strong>Force Acts of 1870 and 1871</strong> in 
  response to murders that the Klan had committed.&nbsp; The Acts enabled Federal troops to 
  stop the atrocities of the Ku Klux Klan.&nbsp; The Acts came too late, though, as the Klan had already intimidated many people.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Johnson Walks the Impeachment Plank</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Congress passed the <strong>Tenure of Office Act</strong> in <strong>1867</strong>.&nbsp; 
  It required the president to secure the consent of the Senate before he could 
  remove his cabinet members once they had been approved by the Senate.&nbsp; Its 
  purpose was to keep the secretary of war, <u>Edwin M. Stanton</u> (a spy for the Republican party), in the 
  president's cabinet.&nbsp; When Johnson dismissed Stanton in <strong>1868</strong>, the House 
  of Representatives voted to <strong>impeach</strong> Johnson for "high crimes and 
  misdemeanors."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A Not-Guilty Verdict for Johnson</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The House of Representatives prosecuted the president, 
while the Senate served as the court to try Johnson on the impeachment charges.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Johnson argued that the Tenure of Office Act was 
  unconstitutional and that he had fired Stanton to challenge the Act before 
  the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On <b>May 16, 1868</b>, the Senate voted the president "not 
guilty" by a margin of one vote.&nbsp; The radical Republicans failed to gain the 
necessary 2/3 majority vote in the Senate to remove the president.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some Senators voted "not guilty" because they feared creating a bad precedent of abusing the checks and balances system. These Senators also did not like the economic policies of Johnson's presidential replacement, <u>Ben Wade</u>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Purchase of Alaska</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In <strong>1867</strong>, Secretary of State <u>William Seward</u> signed a treaty with Russia that gave <strong>Alaska</strong> to the United States for 
  $7.2 million. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Russia sold Alaska to the U.S. because it felt that it was 
over-expanded in North America.&nbsp; Russia also wanted to strengthen the United 
States as a barrier against its enemy, Britain.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although the American people were focused on 
  Reconstruction and anti-expansion, they supported the purchase of Alaska because 
  they did not want to offend the Russians, who had helped them during the Civil 
  War.&nbsp;All Americans did not support this purchase, though, and some referred to it as <strong>Seward's Folly</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Heritage of Reconstruction</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many white Southerners felt that Reconstruction was more painful than the war itself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During Reconstruction, the Republican Party wanted to protect the freed slaves and 
  to promote the fortunes of the Republican Party.&nbsp; These principles removed the party from the South for nearly 100 years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Despite good intentions by the Republicans, Reconstruction did not really change the way that the South treated or viewed blacks. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Thaddeus Stevens</u> had a radical program of drastic 
  economic reforms and extensive protection of political rights.&nbsp; This program was 
  never enacted.</p>

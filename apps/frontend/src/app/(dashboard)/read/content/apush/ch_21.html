<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bull Run Ends the "Ninety-Day War"</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  President Abraham Lincoln decided to attack a small Confederate force at
  <strong>Bull Run</strong>.&nbsp; If successful, the victory would show the
  superiority of Union arms and might eventually lead to the capture of
  <strong>Richmond</strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  On <strong>July 21, 1861</strong>, the Union and Confederate forces met.
  &nbsp;Unexpectedly, the Confederates won as "<u>Stonewall" Jackson</u> held
  his line of Confederate soldiers until reinforcements arrived. The loss for
  the Union dispelled the allusion of a quick end to the war.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>"Tardy George" McClellan and the Peninsular Campaign</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1861</b>, <u>General George B. McClellan</u> was given command of the
  Army of the Potomac.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Starting the <strong>Peninsula Campaign</strong>, McClellan's army launched a
  waterborne attack in the spring of <strong>1862</strong> that moved towards
  <strong>Richmond</strong>. He came to within sight of
  <strong>Richmond</strong> and attacked "Stonewall" Jackson.&nbsp;
  <u>General Robert E. Lee</u> launched a counterattack against the Union
  forces, known as the <strong>Seven Days' Battles</strong>, from June 26 to
  July 2, 1862 and drove McClellan's forces back to the sea.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Northern military plan had <b>6 components</b>:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  1) Slowly suffocate the South by blockading its coasts.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  2) Liberate the slaves and undermine the economic foundation of the South.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  3) Cut the Confederacy in half by seizing control of the Mississippi River.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  4) Dismember the Confederacy by sending troops through Georgia and the
  Carolinas.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  5) Capture its capital at Richmond.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  6) Try everywhere to engage the enemy and grind it into submission.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The War at Sea</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Northern sea <strong>blockades</strong> were concentrated at the South's
  main ports.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  To overcome the strong blockades, fast ships were developed to run through
  them.&nbsp; These ships made a lot of profit by exchanging cargoes of arms
  for<strong> cotton</strong>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1862</strong>, the Confederates created the
  <em><strong> Merrimack </strong></em>and renamed it the
  <strong><em>Virginia</em></strong
  >.&nbsp; It was an old U.S. wooden ship that was plated with metal
  armor.&nbsp; It threatened the Northern blockades because it could crush
  through the Union's wooden ships.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  On <strong>March 9, 1862</strong>, the Union ironclad, the
  <strong><em> Monitor</em></strong
  >, and the Confederate <strong><em>Merrimack </em></strong>met and fought to a
  standstill.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Pivotal Point:&nbsp; Antietam</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  After General Lee crushed McClellan's forces in Richmond, Lee moved
  northward.&nbsp; In the <b>Second Battle of Bull Run</b> (August 29-30, 1862),
  General Lee defeated <u>General Pope's</u> Union forces.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  As Lee moved into Maryland, he met McClellan's forces again at the
  <b>Battle of Antietam</b> on September 17, 1862.&nbsp; McClellan managed to
  halt Lee's forces after his forces discovered Lee's battle plans.&nbsp;
  Although not a victory, the Union stopped the Confederate march northward.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Antietam provided Lincoln with the military backing to issue the preliminary
  <strong>Emancipation Proclamation </strong>on September 23, 1862.&nbsp; On
  January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued a final proclamation.&nbsp; Lincoln now made
  the Civil War a war to end slavery.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A Proclamation without Emancipation</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Emancipation Proclamation called for the freeing of all slaves in
  Confederate territory, except in locations where the Union had mostly regained
  control. Lincoln did not require slaves to be freed in the Border States
  because he feared that they would secede.&nbsp; The proclamation fundamentally
  changed the nature of the war because it effectively removed any chance of a
  negotiated settlement between the North and the South.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>13th Amendment</strong> to the Constitution was passed in 1865, 8
  months after the Civil War ended. This legally ended slavery.
</p>
<p>

  (right side of page).
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  With the Emancipation Proclamation, many people in the South said that Lincoln
  was just trying to stir up slave rebellion.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The North now had a much <b>stronger moral cause</b>. &nbsp;It had to preserve
  the Union and free the slaves.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Blacks Battle Bondage</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  After the Emancipation Proclamation and as manpower ran low, blacks were
  allowed to enlist in the Union army.&nbsp; Towards the end of the war, the
  Confederacy allowed blacks to enlist, but by then it was too late.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Lee's Last Lunge at Gettysburg</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  After Antietam, Lincoln replaced McClellan as commander of the Army of the
  Potomac with <u>General A. E. Burnside</u>. &nbsp;Due to Burnside's massive
  defeat <strong>at Fredericksburg, Virginia</strong> on December 13, 1862, he
  was replaced by <u>Hooker</u>.&nbsp; During the battle at
  <strong> Chancellorsville, Virginia</strong> on May 2-4, 1863, Hooker was
  badly beaten, but not before Jackson was mortally wounded.&nbsp; Hooker was
  replaced by <u>General George G. Meade</u>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  As Lee moved his Confederate force to the north again (this time to
  Pennsylvania), he was met by Meade's force at <strong>Gettysburg</strong> on
  July 1-3, 1863.&nbsp; The failure of General George
  <strong>Pickett's charge </strong> enabled the Union to win the battle.
  &nbsp;Confederate President Jefferson Davis was planning to deliver
  <strong>negotiators</strong> to Washington D.C. after Confederates won at
  Gettysburg.&nbsp; Since the Union ended up winning the battle, Lincoln did not
  negotiate with the South.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  At a cemetery dedication in Gettysburg, Lincoln delivered the<strong>
    Gettysburg Address</strong
  >.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The War in the West</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>Ulysses S. Grant</u> became a colonel in the <strong>Union</strong>
  <strong>volunteer</strong> <strong>army</strong>.&nbsp; His first victory was
  when he captured <strong>Fort Henry and Fort Donelson </strong>in February
  1862.&nbsp; He next planned to capture a line of railroads in the Mississippi
  Valley in Corinth.&nbsp; His plan was foiled when he was defeated by a
  Confederate force at the<strong> Battle of Shiloh</strong> on April 6-7, 1862.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  General Grant was given command of the Union forces attacking
  <b>Vicksburg.&nbsp; </b>The city fell and surrendered on July 4, 1863.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Due to <b>back-to-back</b> Union military <b>victories</b> at the Battle of
  Gettysburg and the Battle of Vicksburg, all Confederate hopes for foreign help
  were lost.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sherman Scorches Georgia</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  General Grant won the battle at <b>Chattanooga</b>, and the state of
  <b>Tennessee</b> was cleared of Confederates.&nbsp; Grant was made general in
  chief due to this win.
</p>
<p>
  <u>General William Tecumseh Sherman</u> led the invasion of
  <strong>Georgia</strong>.&nbsp; He captured <strong>Atlanta</strong> in
  September of 1864 and burned it in November.&nbsp; He destroyed rail lines and
  burned buildings. <strong>Sherman's March</strong> continued on through
  Georgia, intent on destroying supplies destined for the Confederate army. By
  waging war on their homes, Sherman also sought to reduce the morale of the men
  at the front. &nbsp;Sherman captured <strong>Savannah</strong> on December 22,
  1864.&nbsp; He moved up through <strong>South Carolina</strong>, capturing and
  burning <strong>Columbia</strong> on February 17, 1865.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Politics of War</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Critics in President Lincoln's own party were led by secretary of the
  Treasury, <u>Salmon Chase</u>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>Congressional Committee on the Conduct of the War</strong>, formed
  in late <strong>1861</strong>, was dominated by radical Republicans who
  resented emancipation and the expansion of presidential power in wartime.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  After <u>Stephen A. Douglas</u>, the leader of the Democratic Party in the
  North, died, the party split between those who supported Lincoln (<b
    >War Democrats</b
  >) and those who didn't (<b>Peace Democrats</b>).
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Congressman <u>Clement L. Vallandigham</u> was a prominent member in a group
  called the <b>Copperheads</b>, which were radical Peace Democrats.&nbsp;
  Vallandigham was banished from the North to the South by Lincoln but he later
  returned after the war had ended.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Election of 1864</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Fearing defeat, the Republicans joined with the War Democrats to form the
  <strong>Union Party</strong> in the <strong>election of 1864</strong>.&nbsp;
  Lincoln's running-mate was <u>Andrew Johnson</u>, a local War Democrat.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Democrats, including the Copperheads, nominated
  <u> General McClellan </u>was their presidential candidate.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Northern Democrats lost the election of 1864.&nbsp; This was a big defeat
  for the South; the removal of Lincoln was the last hope for a Confederate
  victory.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Grant Outlasts Lee</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  President Lincoln chose General Grant to lead the assault on the Confederate
  capital of <b>Richmond</b>.&nbsp; Grant had 100,000 men and engaged Lee in a
  series of battles in the Wilderness of Virginia (<b>Wilderness Campaign</b
  >).&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  On June 3, 1864, Grant ordered the frontal assault on
  <strong> Cold Harbor</strong>.&nbsp; Thousands of Union soldiers were killed
  within a matter of minutes, but Grant's strategy of losing two Union men to
  one Confederate man worked.&nbsp; He captured Richmond and cornered Lee.&nbsp;
  On <strong>April 9, 1865</strong>, Lee was forced to surrender the Army of
  Northern Virginia (a significant portion of the Confederate army) at
  <strong>Appomattox Courthouse</strong> in Virginia, effectively ending the
  Civil War.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Martyrdom of Lincoln</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  On <strong>April 14, 1865</strong>, President Lincoln was shot and killed at
  <strong>Ford's Theater</strong> by southerner, <u>John Wilkes Booth</u>.&nbsp;
  Andrew Johnson took over as President.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Aftermath of the Nightmare</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Civil War claimed over 600,000 lives and cost over $15 billion (year 2001
  dollars).
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Britain extended the right to vote to more of its people with the
  <strong>Reform Bill of 1867</strong>. American democracy had proven itself and
  the disfranchised British people used this to justify their own democracy.

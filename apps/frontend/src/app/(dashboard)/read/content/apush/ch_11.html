<p>The Triumphs and Travails of the Jeffersonian Republic</p>
<p>1800-1812</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Federalist and Republican Mudslingers</b></p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson became the victim of one of America's 
first "<b>whispering campaigns</b>."&nbsp; The Federalists accused him of having an 
affair with one of his slaves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Jeffersonian "Revolution of 1800"</b></p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson beat John Adams to win the <strong>election of 
  1800</strong> by a majority of 73 to 65 electoral votes.</p>
<p><strong>Revolution of 1800</strong>: the term given to the election of 1800; no Federalist became president after this election. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> Responsibility Breeds Moderation</strong></p>
<p>Unlike his predecessors, after Jefferson's election, he dismissed few public servants for political reasons. </p>
<p><strong>Jeffersonian Restraint</strong></p>
<p>Jefferson quickly pardoned the prisoners of the Sedition 
Acts.&nbsp; The <b>Naturalization Law of 1802 </b>reduced the requirement of 14 years 
of residence to the previous 5 years.</p>
<p>Jefferson also did away with the excise tax.</p>
<p><u>Albert Gallatin:</u> Secretary of Treasury to Jefferson; 
  believed that a national debt wasn't a blessing; he reduced the national debt.</p>

<p><b>The "Dead Clutch" of the Judiciary</b></p>
<p><strong>Judiciary Act of 1801:</strong> passed by the expiring 
  Federalist Congress; created 16 new federal judgeships and other judicial 
  offices.&nbsp; The new <strong>Republican-Democratic Congress </strong>quickly <strong>repealed</strong> the act and kicked out the 16 newly seated judges.&nbsp; One <strong>Federalist judge</strong>, 
  Chief Justice <u>John Marshall</u>, was not removed.&nbsp; He served under presidents 
  including Jefferson and others for 34 years.&nbsp; He shaped the American legal 
  tradition more than any other person.</p>
<p><u>James Madison</u> was the new <b>Secretary of State</b>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Marbury vs. Madison (1803)</em></strong> - James Madison, 
  the new secretary of state, had cut judge Marbury's salary; Marbury sued James 
  Madison for his pay.  The court ruled that Marbury had the right to his pay, but the court did not have the authority to force Madison to give Marbury his pay.  Most importantly,
  this decision showed that the Supreme Court had the final authority in determining the meaning of the 
  Constitution.</p>
<p><u>Samuel Chase<strong>:</strong></u> a Supreme Court justice that the Democratic-Republican Congress tried to impeach; he was not removed due to a lack of votes in 
  the Senate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Jefferson, a Reluctant Warrior</b></p>
<p>Jefferson preferred to make the military smaller.</p>
<p>Jefferson was forced to change his thoughts of not using 
  military force when the leader of <strong>Tripoli </strong>informally declared war on the 
  United States.&nbsp; Jefferson sent the new navy to Tripoli and after 4 years of 
  fighting<strong>,</strong> a deal was reached.&nbsp; The U.S. paid Tripoli $60,000 for the 
  release of captured Americans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Louisiana Godsend</b></p>
<p><u>Napoleon Bonaparte</u> convinced the king of Spain to <strong> give Louisiana land area to France in 1800.</strong></p>
<p>Not wanting to fight Napoleon and France in western America, Jefferson sent <u>James Monroe</u> to join <u>Robert Livingston</u> in Paris in <b>1803</b> to buy as much land as he could for $10 million.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Napoleon decided to sell all of Louisiana and <b>abandon 
his dream of a New World Empire </b>for 2 reasons: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">1) He failed to 
  re-conquer the island of Santo Domingo, for which Louisiana was to serve as a 
  source of foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">2) Because Britain controlled the 
  seas, Napoleon didn't want Britain to take over Louisiana. Selling the land to America removed this possibility and it gave Napoleon much-needed cash. He also hoped giving the land to America would help make America a world-power that would disrupt the ambitions of the British king.</p>
<p><u>Robert Livingston:</u> along with James Monroe, he negotiated in Paris for the 
  Louisiana land area; signed a treaty on<strong> April 30, 1803, </strong>ceding <strong> Louisiana</strong> to the United States for <strong>$15 million</strong>.&nbsp; The Americans had 
  signed 3 treaties and gotten much land to the west of the Mississippi.&nbsp; <strong> 820,000 square miles</strong> at 3 cents/acre.&nbsp; (<strong>Louisiana Purchase</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana in the Long View </strong></p>
<p>Jefferson sent his personal secretary, <u>Meriwether Lewis</u> and a military officer, <u>William Clark</u> to explore the northern part of the <strong>Louisiana 
  Purchase</strong>.</p>

	<p><b>The Aaron Burr Conspiracies</b></p>
<p><u>Aaron Burr:</u> Jefferson's first-term vice president; 
  after being dropped from Jefferson's cabinet, he joined a group of extremist 
  Federalists who <strong>plotted the secession of New England and New York</strong>; 
  Alexander Hamilton uncovered the plot.&nbsp; Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel<strong> </strong>and Hamilton accepted.&nbsp; <strong>Hamilton refused to shoot and he was shot and 
    killed </strong>by Burr.</p>
<p><u>General James Wilkinson:</u> the corrupt military 
  governor of the Louisiana Territory; made an allegiance with<strong> Burr</strong> to separate 
  the western part of the United States from the East and expand their <strong>new 
    confederacy with invasions of Spanish-controlled Mexico and Florida;</strong> betrayed Burr when he learned that Jefferson knew of the plot; Burr was 
  acquitted of the charges of treason by Chief Justice John Marshall and he fled to Europe. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A Precarious Neutrality</b></p>
<p>Jefferson was <b>reelected in 1804</b>, capturing 162 electoral votes, while his Federalist opponent (Charles Pinckney) only received 14 votes.</p>
<p>England was the power of the seas, and France had the power 
of land.</p>
<p><strong>England</strong> issued a series of <strong>Orders in Council</strong> in <strong>1806</strong>.&nbsp; They closed the European ports under French control to foreign 
  shipping.&nbsp; The <strong>French </strong>ordered the <strong>seizure of all merchant ships</strong> that entered British ports.</p>
<p><strong>Chesapeake Affair:</strong> a royal ship attacked the U.S. frigate, the Chesapeake, after the Americans refused to returned four alleged British deserters. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Hated Embargo</b></p>
<p>In <b>1807</b>, Jefferson passed the <b>Embargo Act</b>.&nbsp; 
It banned the exportation of any goods to any countries.&nbsp; With the act, 
Jefferson planned to force France and England, who both depended on American 
trade, to respect America and its citizens, who had been killed and captured by 
both countries.&nbsp; The embargo significantly hurt the profits of U.S. merchants and was
consequently hated by Americans.</p>
<p>The act was repealed in <b>1809</b> and a substitute act 
was enacted: The <b>Non-Intercourse Act</b>.&nbsp; It opened up trade to every 
country except France and Britain.</p>
<p>The<strong> embargo failed because</strong> Jefferson overestimated 
  the dependence of Britain and France on America's trade. Britain was able to trade with the 
  Latin American republics and France had enough land in Europe to support itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Madison's Gamble</b></p>
<p><u>James Madison</u> became president on <b>March 4, 1809</b>.</p>
<p>Congress issued <strong>Macon's Bill No. 2. </strong> It reopened 
  American trade with the entire world, but it had a clause stating that if Britain or France repealed its commercial restrictions, then the U.S. would reinstate its trading embargo against the non-repealing country. Napoleon convinced James Madison to give 
  Britain three months to lift its Orders in Council.&nbsp; Madison did, but Britain chose 
  not to lift its Orders in Council, and Madison had to re-enact the United 
  States's trade embargo, but this time just against Britain.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Macon's Bill No. 2 led to the <b>War of 1812</b>.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Tecumseh and the Prophet</b></p>
<p><strong>Twelfth Congress:</strong> met in 1811; the "war hawks" 
  wanted to go to war with the British and wanted to eliminate the Indian threats 
  to pioneers.</p>
<p><u>Tecumseh &amp; Tenskwatawa:</u> Shawnee brothers who unified 
  many Indian tribes in a last ditch battle with the settlers; allied with the 
  British.</p>

<p><u>William Henry Harrison:</u> governor of the Indiana 
  territory; defeated the Shawnee at the Battle of Tippecanoe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Mr. Madison's War</b></p>
<p>On <b>June 1, 1812</b>, Madison asked Congress to declare 
war on the British and it agreed.</p>
<p>The <b>Democratic-Republicans</b> who 
supported the war ("<b>war hawks</b>") felt that the country had 
to assert American rights to the world.&nbsp; They wanted to invade Canada, the 
Indians' stronghold, because the Indians were being armed by the British to 
attack the settlers.</p>
<p>The <b>Federalists were opposed </b>because they supported 
Britain.</p>

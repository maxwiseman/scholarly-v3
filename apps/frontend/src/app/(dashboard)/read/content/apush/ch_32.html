<h3>Chapter 32</h3>
<h4>The Politics of Boom and Bust</h4>
<h4>1920-1932</h4>
<hr />
<p><b>The Republican "Old Guard" Returns</b></p>
<p>
  <u>Warren G. Harding</u> was inaugurated in <b>1921</b>.&nbsp; He was unable
  to detect corruption in his own staff.&nbsp; He was a very soft guy in that he
  hated to say "no," hurting peoples' feelings.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Charles Evans Hughes</u> was the secretary of state.&nbsp;
  <u> Andrew W. Mellon</u>, Pittsburgh's multimillionaire aluminium king, was
  the secretary of the Treasury.&nbsp; <u>Herbert Hoover</u> was the secretary
  of commerce.
</p>
<p>
  Harding's brightest and most capable officials (above) were offset by two of
  the worst:&nbsp; <u>Senator Albert B. Fall</u>, an anti-conservationist who
  was the secretary of the interior, and <u>Harry M. Daugherty</u>, a crook who
  was the attorney general.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GOP Reaction at the Throttle</b></p>
<p>
  Industrialists wanted the government to stop legislating business and to
  actually help businesses make profits.
</p>
<p>
  In the first years of the 1920s, the Supreme Court struck down progressive
  legislation.&nbsp; The Supreme Court ruled in
  <b><i>Adkins v. Children's Hospital</i> </b>(<b>1923</b>) that women did not
  deserve special protection in the workplace. They said that the 19<sup
    >th</sup
  >
  Amendment made women the legal equals of men.
</p>
<p>
  Corporations under President Harding could expand without worries of antitrust
  laws.
</p>
<p>
  The Interstate Commerce Commission was led by men who were sympathetic to the
  managers of the railroads.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Aftermath of War</b></p>
<p>
  Industrialists convinced the government to release control that it had
  installed on the economy during WWI. The
  <b>Esch-Cummins Transportation Act of 1920</b> returned the railroads to
  private management.&nbsp;It pledged the Interstate Commerce Commission to
  guarantee their profitability.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Merchant Marine Act of 1920</b> authorized the government to sell its
  wartime fleet of 1500 vessels at extremely low prices.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>La Follette Seaman's Act of 1915</b> improved working conditions for
  sailors but it economically hurt the American shipping industry because they
  now had a hard time competing with foreigners, who did not treat their crews
  very well.
</p>
<p>
  Labor struggled without friendly government support; there were a lot of
  strikes and wage cuts.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1921</b>, Congress created the <b>Veterans Bureau </b> to operate
  hospitals and provide vocational rehabilitation for the disabled.&nbsp; The
  <b>American Legion</b> was created in <b>1919</b> by Colonel Theodore
  Roosevelt, Jr.&nbsp; It was a support/social group for veterans. The legion
  convinced Congress in <b>1924</b> to pass the
  <b>Adjusted Compensation Act</b>, which gave every former soldier a sum of
  money, depending on their years of service.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>America Seeks Benefits Without Burdens</b></p>
<p>
  Because the Treaty of Versailles was rejected, the United States had
  technically been at war with Germany, Austria, and Hungary for 3 years after
  the armistice.&nbsp; Congress passed a joint resolution in July 1921 that
  officially declared the war over.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Isolationism</b> was prominent in Washington.&nbsp; President Harding hated
  the <b>League of Nations</b> and at first, he refused to support the League's
  world health program.
</p>
<p>
  Secretary Hughes secured the rights for American oil companies to share oil
  lands in the Middle East with Britain.
</p>
<p>
  Several world powers met at the <b>Washington "Disarmament" Conference</b> in
  <b>1921-1922</b> to discuss <b> disarmament</b> of their respective navies.
  Secretary Hughes led the American delegation. The
  <strong>Five-Power Naval Treaty of 1922</strong> limited the construction of
  certain types of large naval ships, and it applied ratio limits to the number
  of ships a country could build (ex: Japan could build 3/5 as many ships as
  America). Submarines and destroyers were not restricted. <b></b> It also
  stated that the British and Americans would refrain from fortifying their Far
  Eastern possessions, including the Philippines.&nbsp; The Japanese were not
  subjected to such restraints in their possessions.
</p>
<p>
  A <b>Four-Power Treaty</b> between Britain, Japan, France and the United
  States replaced the 20-year old Anglo-Japanese Treaty and preserved the status
  quo in the Pacific.
</p>
<p>
  In the late 1920s, Americans called for the "outlaw of war."&nbsp; Calvin
  Coolidge's secretary of state <u>Frank. B. Kellogg</u> signed with the French
  foreign minister in <b>1928</b> the <b>Kellogg-Briand Pact</b>. Known as the
  <b> Pact of Paris</b>, it was ratified by 62 nations.&nbsp;It tried to outlaw
  war, but it had a big exception: defensive wars were still permitted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Hiking the Tariff Higher</b></p>
<p>
  Because businessmen did not want Europe flooding American markets with cheap
  goods after the war, Congress passed the <b>Fordney-McCumber Tariff Law</b> in
  <b>1922</b>, raising the tariff from 27% to 35%.
</p>
<p>
  Presidents Harding and Coolidge were much more prone to increasing tariffs
  than decreasing them; this presented a problem: Europe needed to sell goods to
  the U.S. to get the money to pay back its war debts. Europeans responded by
  also increasing tariffs.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>The Stench of Scandal</b>
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1923</b>, Colonel <u>Charles R. Forbes</u>, head of the Veterans Bureau,
  was caught stealing $200 million from the government, chiefly in connection
  with the building of veterans' hospitals.
</p>
<p>
  In the <b>Teapot Dome scandal</b> <b>(1921)</b>, the secretary of the
  interior, <u>Albert B. Fall</u>, convinced the secretary of the navy to
  transfer valuable oil-laden land to the Interior Department (the land was
  owned by the navy). Fall was then bribed with $100,000 to leased the lands to
  oilmen <u> Harry F. Sinclair</u> and <u>Edward L. Doheny</u>.
</p>
<p>
  Attorney General Daugherty was accused of illegal selling pardons and liquor
  permits.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  President Harding <b>died</b> in San Francisco on <b>August 2, 1923</b> of
  pneumonia and thrombosis.

<p><b>"Silent Cal" Coolidge</b></p>
<p>
  Vice President <u>Calvin Coolidge</u> took over the presidency following
  Harding's death.&nbsp; He was extremely shy and delivered very boring
  speeches.
</p>
<p>
  Coolidge did not change the business-friendly policies that Harding had
  created.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Frustrated Farmers</b>
</p>
<p>
  After the end of WWI, farms struggled because the Federal government stopped
  guaranteeing high prices and other nations started to grow more crops.&nbsp;
  Machines also enabled farmers to grow more crops, but this created crop
  surpluses, which decreased prices.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Capper-Volstead Act</b> exempted farmers' marketing cooperatives from
  anti-trust prosecution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The <b>McNary-Haugen Bill</b> sought to keep agricultural prices high by
  authorizing the government to buy crop surpluses and sell them abroad.&nbsp;
  President Coolidge vetoed the bill because the bill would've cost the
  government money.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>A Three-Way Race for the White House in 1924</b>
</p>
<p>
  Preceding the election of 1924, the Democratic party was split into many
  different factions. They eventually chose <u>John W. Davis</u> to compete
  against <u>Calvin Coolidge</u> (Republican) and
  <u>La Follette</u> (Progressive) for the presidency.
</p>
<p>
  Senator <u>La Follette</u> from Wisconsin led the new liberal
  <b> Progressive party</b>.&nbsp; He was endorsed by the American Federation of
  Labor and by farmers.&nbsp; The Progressives called for government ownership
  of railroads and relief for farmers, opposed monopolies and antilabor
  injunctions, and supported a constitutional amendment to limit the Supreme
  Court's power to invalidate laws passed by Congress.
</p>
<p><u>Calvin Coolidge</u> won the <b>election of 1924</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Foreign-Policy Flounderings</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Isolationism</b> continued in Coolidge's second term. Exception to this
  were in the <b>Caribbean</b> and <b>Central America</b>, where Americans
  participated in a few armed conflicts in Haiti and Nicaragua.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1926</b>, the Mexican government declared control over its oil
  resources.&nbsp; Despite American oil companies support for war, Coolidge
  resolved the situation diplomatically.
</p>
<p>
  After WWI, America became a creditor to the world, loaning money to various
  countries.
</p>
<p>
  The United States demanded to be repaid for the $10 billion that it had loaned
  to the Allies in WWI.&nbsp; The Allies protested the debt, pointing out that
  they had lost many troops and that America should just write off the loans as
  war costs. America's postwar tariffs also made it difficult for the European
  Allies to make money to pay their debts.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Unraveling the Debt Knot</b>
</p>
<p>
  America's demand for repayment from France and Britain caused these countries
  to demand war reparations from Germany. The Allies hoped to pay their American
  debts with the money received from Germany.
</p>
<p>
  Negotiated by <u>Charles Dawes</u>, the <b>Dawes Plan of 1924</b> addressed
  the debt repayment issue.&nbsp; It set up German reparations and allowed for
  Americans to make private loans to Germany.&nbsp;The Germans used these loans
  to pay the reparations, which the Allies used to pay the war debts to the
  Americans.
</p>
<p>
  A downturn in the global economy disrupted the flow of money, and because of
  this,
  <b>the United States never fully received its war repayments from Europe.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>The Triumph of Herbert Hoover, 1928</b>
</p>
<p>
  When Calvin Coolidge decided not to run for <b>re-election in 1928</b>, the
  Republicans chose <u>Herbert Hoover</u>. Hoover supported
  <strong>isolationism</strong>, <b>individualism</b>, <b>free enterprise</b>,
  and <b>small government</b>.&nbsp; He was a good leader. Other strengths were
  his integrity, humanitarianism, passion for assembling the facts, efficiency,
  talents for administration, and ability to inspire loyalty in close
  associates.
</p>
<p>
  The Democrats nominated <u>Alfred E. Smith</u>.&nbsp; He was a Roman Catholic
  in an overwhelmingly Protestant country.
</p>
<p>
  For the first time, the <b>radio</b> was widely used in election
  campaigns.&nbsp; It mostly helped Hoover's campaign.
</p>
<p>
  Smith was unable to win the South due to a combination of his Catholicism,
  opposition to prohibition, and liberal ideals.&nbsp;
  <strong>Herbert Hoover won the election of 1928</strong> in a landslide,
  becoming the first Republican candidate in 52 years (except for Harding's
  Tennessee victory), to win a state that had seceded.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <b>&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>President Hoover's First Moves</b>
</p>
<p>
  The disorganized <b>wage earners</b> and the disorganized <b>farmers</b> were
  not getting rich in the growing economy.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Agricultural Marketing Act</b>, passed in <b>1929</b>, was designed to
  help the farmers by setting up the <b>Federal Farm Board</b>. The Board
  purchased agricultural surpluses, hoping to stabilize agriculture prices. The
  Board created the <b>Grain Stabilization Corporation</b> and the
  <b>Cotton Stabilization Corporation</b>, which also purchased surpluses. The
  corporations failed after farmers produced too much surplus, exceeding the
  budget of the Board.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Hawley-Smoot Tariff of 1930</b> was intended to be a mild tariff, but
  Congress tacked on several amendments, turning it into a bill that raised the
  tariff to 60%. This was the nation's highest protective tariff during
  peacetime.&nbsp; The tariff deepened the depression that had already begun in
  America and other nations, and it increased international financial chaos.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>The Great Crash Ends the Golden Twenties</b>
</p>
<p>
  The stock market <b>crashed</b> in <b>October 1929</b>.&nbsp; It was partially
  triggered by the British, who raised their interest rates in an effort to
  bring back capital lured abroad by American investments.&nbsp; The British
  needed money, and they were unable to trade with the United States due the
  high tariffs.
</p>
<p>
  On "<b>Black Tuesday</b>" of <b>October 29, 1929</b>, millions of stocks were
  sold in a panic.&nbsp; By the end of 1929, two months after the initial crash,
  stockholders had lost $40 billion.
</p>
<p>
  As a result of the crash, millions lost their jobs and thousands of banks
  closed. The United States was the hardest industrialized nation to be hit.
</p>
<p>This crash led to the <strong>Great Depression</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Hooked on the Horn of Plenty</b>
</p>
<p>
  One of the <b>main causes</b> of the <b>Great Depression</b> was
  <strong>overproduction</strong> by farms and factories.&nbsp; The nation's
  ability to produce goods had outrun its capacity to consume or pay for
  them.&nbsp; All of the money was being invested in factories and other
  agencies of production; not enough money was going into salaries and wages.
  Over-expansion of credit also contributed to the depression.
</p>
<p>
  The Great Depression worsened the economic state in Europe, which had not yet
  fully recovered from WWI.
</p>
<p>
  In the 1930s, a <b>drought</b> scorched the Mississippi Valley, causing
  thousands of farms to be sold.
</p>
<p><strong>Hoovervilles</strong>: a nickname for tin-and-paper shantytowns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Rugged Times for Rugged Individuals</b>
</p>
<p>
  In the beginning of the Great Depression, President Hoover believed that
  industry and self-reliance had made America great and that the government
  should play no role in the welfare of the people.&nbsp; He soon realized,
  however, that the welfare of the people in a nationwide catastrophe was a
  direct concern of the government.
</p>
<p>
  Hoover developed a <b>plan</b> in which the government would help the
  railroads, banks, and rural credit corporations in the hope that if financial
  health was restored at the top of the economic pyramid, then unemployment
  would be relieved as the prosperity trickled down.&nbsp; Hoover's efforts were
  criticized because he gave government money to the big bankers who had
  allegedly started the depression.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Hoover Battles the Great Depression</b>
</p>
<p>
  President Hoover convinced Congress to allocate $2.25 billion for useful
  <b>public works</b>.&nbsp; (ex: the Hoover Dam)
</p>
<p>
  Hoover opposed any projects that he viewed as "socialistic."&nbsp; Ex: He
  vetoed the <b>Muscle Shoals Bill</b>, which was designed to dam the Tennessee
  River and sell government-produced electricity in competition with citizens in
  private companies.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1932</b>, Congress created the
  <b>Reconstruction Finance Corporation</b> (RFC), which lent money to insurance
  companies, banks, agricultural organizations, railroads, and state and local
  governments.
</p>
<p>
  Congress passed the <b>Norris-La Guardia Anti-Injunction Act</b> in
  <b>1932</b>, which outlawed antiunion contracts and barred federal courts from
  stopping strikes, boycotts, and peaceful picketing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Routing the Bonus Army in Washington</b>
</p>
<p>
  Veterans of WWI were hit hard by the Great Depression. The "<b
    >Bonus Expeditionary Force</b
  >" (BEF) converged on the Capitol in the summer of 1932. They demanded that
  Congress fully pay the deferred bonus that Congress had passed in 1924 (the
  payment was supposed to be paid in 1945).
</p>
<p>
  After the BEF refused to leave the Capitol, President Hoover sent in the army
  to evacuate the group.&nbsp; The ensuing riots and incidents brought
  additional public disdain for Hoover.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Japanese Militarists Attack China</b>
</p>
<p>
  In September <b>1931</b>, <b>Japanese</b> <b>imperialists</b>, seeing that the
  West was bogged down in the Great Depression, invaded the Chinese province of
  <b>Manchuria</b>.&nbsp; Although a direct violation of the League of Nations,
  the League was unable to do anything because it lacked America's support.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1932</b>, Secretary of State <u>Henry L. Stimson </u>decided to only
  diplomatically attack the Japanese. He issued the <b>Stimson doctrine</b>,
  which declared that the United States would not recognize any territory
  acquired by force.&nbsp; Japan ignored the doctrine and moved onto
  <b> Shanghai</b> in <b>1932</b>.&nbsp; The violence continued without the
  League of Nation's intervention.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Hoover Pioneers the Good Neighbor Policy</b>
</p>
<p>
  President Hoover sought to improve relations with Latin America. He withdrew
  American troops from Haiti and Nicaragua.
</p>
<p>
  Hoover's actions laid the groundwork for future President Roosevelt's
  <b>"Good Neighbor" policy</b>.

<h3>Chapter 23</h3>
<h4>Political Paralysis in the Gilded Age</h4>
<h4>1869-1896</h>
<hr>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The "Bloody Shirt" Elects Grant</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Republicans nominated <u>General Grant</u> for the 
  presidency in <strong>1868</strong>.&nbsp; The Republican Party supported the continued Reconstruction of the South, while Grant stood on the platform of "just 
  having peace."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Democrats nominated <u>Horatio Seymour</u>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Grant won the election of 1868.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The Era of Good Stealings</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Jim Fisk</u> and <u>Jay Gould</u> devised a plot to 
  drastically raise the price of the gold market in <strong>1869</strong>. &nbsp;The two men bought and hoarded a large amount of gold, driving up the price. On "<strong>Black 
Friday</strong>," September 24, 1869, the  Treasury was forced to sell gold from its reserves to lower the high price of gold. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"<u>Boss" Tweed</u> employed bribery, graft, and 
  fraudulent elections to milk New York of as much as $200 million.&nbsp; (<strong>Tweed 
    Ring</strong>)&nbsp; Tweed was eventually put into prison.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A Carnival of Corruption</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Members of the federal government also participated in illicit/unethical activity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Credit Mobilier</strong> scandal erupted in <strong>1872</strong> when Union Pacific Railroad insiders formed the Credit Mobilier construction 
  company and then hired themselves at inflated prices to build the railroad line, 
  earnings a lot of money. The company paid off members of Congress and the Vice President.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Liberal Republican Revolt of 1872</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Liberal Republican Party</strong> was formed in 1872 in response to the political corruption in 
  Washington and their dissatisfaction with military Reconstruction.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Liberal Republican Party met in Cincinnati and chose <u>
Horace Greeley</u> as their presidential candidate for the election of 1872.&nbsp; 
The Democratic Party also chose Greeley as their candidate.&nbsp; The Republican 
Party continued to put its support behind President Grant.&nbsp; Grant won the <b>
election of 1872</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Liberal Republicans caused the Republican Congress to 
  pass a general <strong>amnesty act</strong> in <strong>1872, </strong>removing political 
  restrictions from most of the former Confederate leaders.&nbsp; Congress also reduced 
  high Civil War tariffs and gave mild civil-service reform to the Grant 
  administration. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Depression, Deflation, and Inflation</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Over-speculation was the primary cause of the <strong>panic of 
  1873</strong>. Banks gave too many imprudent loans to support over-expansion. When profits failed to materialize, people were unable to pay back their loans.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mistrust of the government lead to high inflation of the <strong>greenback</strong>. 
  Supported by advocates of hard money (coin money), the <strong>Resumption Act of 1875</strong> required the government to continue to withdraw greenbacks from circulation and 
  to redeem all paper currency in gold at face value beginning in <strong>1879</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The coinage of silver dollars was stopped by Congress in <strong> 1873</strong> when silver miners began to stop selling their silver to the federal 
  mints; miners could receive more money for the silver, elsewhere.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The policy of the Treasury accumulating gold stock to replace the greenbacks was known as "<strong>contraction</strong>."&nbsp;This policy increased the value of the greenback due to its reduction in circulation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Republican hard-money policy had negative political ramifications and it helped to elect a Democratic House of Representatives in 1874.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Pallid Politics in the Gilded Age</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Throughout most of the <strong>Gilded Age</strong> (a name given to 
  the 30 years after the Civil War by Mark Twain) the political parties in 
  government had balanced out.&nbsp;Few significant economic issues separated the Democrats and Republicans. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Republican</strong> voters tended to stress strict codes of 
  personal morality and believed that the government should play a role in 
  regulating the economic and moral affairs of society.&nbsp; They were located in 
  the Midwest and Northeast.&nbsp; Many Republican votes came from the <strong>Grand Army of 
    the Republic</strong>,<strong> </strong>a politically active fraternal organization consisting of many 
  Union veterans of the Civil War.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Democrats</b> were immigrant Lutherans and Roman 
Catholics who believed in toleration of differences in an imperfect world.&nbsp; They 
also opposed the government imposing a single moral standard on the entire 
society.&nbsp; Democrats were found in the South and in the northern industrial 
cities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Both parties supported <strong>patronage</strong>, the principle of giving jobs to your political supporters. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Hayes-Tilden Standoff, 1876</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Congress passed a resolution that limited the presidency to two terms, after Grant started to consider running for a 3<sup>rd</sup> term.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Republicans chose <u>Rutherford B. Hayes</u> as their 
presidential candidate for the <b>election of 1876</b>.&nbsp; The Democrats chose <u>
Samuel J. Tilden</u>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the election, Tilden won the popular vote, but he was 1 
  vote shy from winning in the Electoral College (184 of 185). &nbsp;20 electoral votes were in dispute in Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida. Each state had sent two ballot counts to Congress. One ballot count said that the Republicans had won, while the other count said that the Democrats had won.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Controversy arose over which candidate should be awarded the disputed electoral votes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Compromise of 1877</strong> was passed by Congress in <strong>1877</strong>. Contained within the compromise was the&nbsp;Electoral Count Act, which set up an electoral commission consisting of 
  15 men from the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Supreme 
  Court. The commission ultimately gave the election to Hayes (Republican). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Democrats were outraged at the outcome of the election, but agreed that Hayes could take office if he withdrew the federal troops from 
  Louisiana and South Carolina.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the Hayes-Tilden deal, the Republican Party abandoned 
its commitment to racial equality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Civil Rights Act of 1875</strong> was supposed to guarantee equal accommodations in public places and prohibited racial discrimination in 
  jury selection.&nbsp; The Supreme Court ultimately ruled most of the Act 
  unconstitutional, stating that the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment only prohibited <em>government</em> violations of civil rights, not the denial of civil rights by <em>individuals</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Birth of Jim Crow in the Post-Reconstruction South</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After Reconstruction ended in the South, white Democrats ("Redeemers") resumed political power in the South and began to enact laws discriminating against blacks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Blacks were forced into <strong>sharecropping</strong> and tenant farming.&nbsp; 
  Through the "<strong>crop-lien</strong>" system, small farmers who rented land from 
  the plantation owners were kept in perpetual debt and forced to continue to work 
  for the owners.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Eventually, state-level legal codes of segregation known as <strong>Jim Crow laws</strong> were enacted.&nbsp; The Southern states also enacted literacy 
  requirements, voter-registration laws, and poll taxes to ensure that Southern blacks could not vote.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the South's segregation 
  in the case of <strong><em>Plessy </em>vs. <em> Ferguson </em></strong>(1896), declaring that "separate but equal" facilities for blacks were legal under the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Class Conflicts and Ethnic Clashes</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Following the panic of 1873 and the resulting depression, 
railroad workers went on strike after their wages were cut by President Hayes.&nbsp; 
The strike failed, exposing the weakness of the labor movement.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many immigrants came to United States hoping to find riches, but many were dismayed when they found none. They either 
  returned home or remained in America and faced extraordinary hardships.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">People on the West Coast attributed declining wages and 
  economic troubles to the hated Chinese workers.&nbsp; To appease them, Congress 
  passed the <strong>Chinese Exclusion Act</strong> in <strong>1882</strong>, stopping Chinese 
  immigration into America.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Garfield and Arthur</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because President Hayes was despised by his own Republican 
  Party, <u>James A. Garfield</u> was chosen as the presidential candidate for the <strong>election of 1880</strong>. &nbsp;Garfield was apart of the <strong>Half-Breed</strong> faction of the Republican Party. His Vice President, <u>Chester A. Arthur</u>, was apart of the <strong>Stalwart</strong> faction.&nbsp; The Democrats chose Civil War hero, <u>Winfield Scott</u>.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Garfield won the election of 1880, but he was assassinated by <u>Charles J. Guiteau</u> at a Washington railroad station. The expected implication of the assassination was that after Arthur took over as president, he would replace the Half-Breed Republican employees with Stalwarts. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The death of Garfield shocked politicians into <strong>reforming</strong> the spoils system.&nbsp; The reform was supported by President Arthur, shocking his 
  critics.&nbsp; The <strong>Pendleton Act of 1883</strong> made mandatory campaign contributions from 
  federal employees illegal, and it established the <strong>Civil Service Commission</strong> to make appointments to federal jobs on the basis of merit. &nbsp;The civil-service reform 
  forced politicians to gain support and funds from big-business leaders.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Blaine-Cleveland Mudslingers of 1884</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Republicans chose <u>James G. Blaine</u> as their 
presidential candidate for the <b>election of 1884</b>.&nbsp; The Democrats chose <u>
Grover Cleveland</u>.&nbsp; Grover Cleveland was a very honest and admirable man.&nbsp; 
Cleveland won the election of 1884.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>"Old Grover" Takes Over</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cleveland was the first Democrat to take over the presidency in 28 years.&nbsp;He replaced thousands of federal employees with Democrats.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cleveland believed that while the people support the government, the government should not support the people.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cleveland Battles for a Lower Tariff</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Treasury was running a budget surplus due to revenue generated by the high tariff that was enacted during the Civil War. To reduce this surplus, President Cleveland convinced Congress to <strong>lower the tariff</strong> in <strong>1887</strong>. The Republicans opposed lowering the tariff because they thought it would hurt businesses. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Republicans chose <u>Benjamin Harrison</u> as their 
  presidential candidate for the <strong>1888 election</strong>. &nbsp;The Republicans made tariffs an issue for the election of 1888. Cleveland won the popular vote, but <strong>Harrison still won the election</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Billion-Dollar Congress</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Republican Speaker of the House, <u>Thomas B. Reed</u>, took control of the House and used intimidation to get Congress to pass several debated bills. The <strong>Billion-Dollar Congress</strong>, 
  named for its lavish spendings, gave pensions to Civil War veterans, increased 
  government purchases on silver, and passed the <strong>McKinley Tariff Act of 1890</strong>.&nbsp;This significantly raised tariffs and financially hurt farmers. Farmers were forced to buy expensive products from American manufacturers while selling their own products into the highly competitive world markets. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The McKinley Tariff Act caused the Republican Party to lose public 
  support and lose their majority in Congress in the congressional elections of 1890.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Drumbeat of Discontent</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>People's Party</strong>, or "<strong>Populists</strong>," formed 
  from frustrated farmers in the agricultural belts of the West and South. They called for a graduated income tax; government ownership of the railroads, 
  telegraph, and telephone; the direct election of U.S. senators; a one-term limit 
  on the presidency; the adoption of the initiative and referendum to allow 
  citizens to shape legislation more directly; a shorter workday; and immigration 
  restriction.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Populists nominated <u>General James B. Weaver</u> for 
the presidential <b>election of 1892</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In <strong>1892</strong>, a series of violent worker strikes swept 
  through the nation, including the <strong>Homestead Strike</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Populist Party did not win the election.&nbsp; 
  One of the main reasons was that the party supported the 
  black community.&nbsp; The party's leaders, such as <u>Thomas Edward Watson</u>, felt that a 
  black man had a right to vote.&nbsp; The party counted on many black votes from the South, but many Southern blacks were denied the right 
  to vote through literacy tests and poll taxes.&nbsp; The Southern whites voted against the party because of the party's equal rights views toward blacks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cleveland and Depression</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Grover Cleveland again ran for president in the <strong> election of 1892</strong> and won, beating out the Populist Party and the Republican Party.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>panic of 1893</strong> was the United States' worst economic depression in the 1800s. &nbsp;It was caused by 
  overbuilding, over-speculation, and the agricultural 
  depression.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890</strong> was created 
  by Benjamin Harrison, and it forced the government to purchase a certain amount of silver every month. Indebted farmers pushed for the Act because they wanted to cause inflation so they could pay off their debts with cheaper money. People started to exchange their silver for gold from the government. An increase in silver production lead to a significant drain on the Treasury's gold reserves, which decreased confidence in the country's finances. Because of this, Cleveland was forced to <strong>repeal</strong> the Sherman Silver Act Purchase in 1893.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">J.P. Morgan lent the government $65 million in gold to increase the Treasury's reserve. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cleveland Breeds a Backlash</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Wilson-Gorman Tariff of</strong> <strong>1894</strong> lowered 
  tariffs and added a 2% tax on incomes over $4,000.&nbsp; The Supreme Court ruled 
  income taxes <strong>unconstitutional</strong> in <strong>1895</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The embarrassment over the Wilson-Gorman Tariff caused the Democrats to lose 
  seats in Congress, giving the Republicans an majority in Congress.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, Harrison, and Cleveland 
  were known as the "<strong>forgettable presidents</strong>."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Chapter 12</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Second War for Independence and the Upsurge of 
Nationalism</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1812-1824</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>On to Canada over Land and Lakes</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Americans tried to invade Canada from Detroit, Niagara, 
  and Lake Champlain.&nbsp; All were fought off by the Canadians.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Americans then attacked by sea and were more 
successful.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Oliver Hazard Perry:</u> captured a British fleet in 
  Lake Erie.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">General Harrison's army overtook the British at Detroit and 
  Fort Malden in the<strong> Battle of the </strong><strong>Thames in October 1813</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Thomas Macdonough:</u> naval officer who forced the 
  invading British army near <strong>Plattsburgh</strong> to retreat on <strong>September 11, 
    1814</strong>; he saved upper New York from British conquest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Washington Burned and New Orleans Defended</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In August of 1814, a second British force attacked Washington D.C. They <strong>burned</strong> most of the capital, including the<strong> White House and Capitol</strong>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Francis Scott Key</u>: American prisoner aboard a British ship who watched the British fleet bombard Fort McHenry; wrote the "Star Spangled Banner." </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Andrew Jackson</u> defended New Orleans at the <strong>Battle of New Orleans.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Treaty of Ghent</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Tsar Alexander I of Russia</u> called the Americans and 
British to come to peace because he didn't want his British ally to lose 
strength in the Americas and let Napoleon take over Europe.&nbsp; The<b> Treaty of 
Ghent</b>, signed on <b>December 24, 1814 </b>in Ghent, Belgium, was an 
armistice.&nbsp; John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay went to Ghent for the signing.&nbsp; 
Both sides stopped fighting and conquered territory was restored.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Federalist Grievances and the Hartford Convention</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island </b>met in
<b>1814</b> in Hartford, Connecticut for a secret meeting to discuss their 
disgust of the war and to redress their grievances. &nbsp;The <b>Hartford 
Convention's</b> final report demanded:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- Financial assistance from 
Washington to compensate for lost trade from embargoes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- Constitutional amendments 
requiring a 2/3 vote in Congress before an embargo could be imposed, new states 
admitted, or war declared.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- The abolition of slavery.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- A President could only serve 
  1 term.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- The abolition of the 3/5 clause.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- The prohibition of the election 
of 2 successive Presidents from the same state.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Few took serious interest in the demands in the wake of the Ghent treaty. The Hartford resolutions marked the <strong>death of the 
  Federalist party</strong>.&nbsp; The party nominated their last presidential candidate in 
  1816.</p>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Second War for American Independence</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>War of 1812</strong> showed other nations around the 
  world that America would defend its beliefs.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Rush-Bagot Agreement </strong>was made between the U.S. and Britain in 1817, and it limited the naval armament on the Great Lakes. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Nascent Nationalism </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The most impressive by-product of 
  the War of 1812 was heightened <strong>nationalism.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The army and navy were expanded and the Bank of the United 
States was revived by Congress in 
1816.</p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>"The American System"</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Congress instituted the <strong>1<sup>st</sup> protective tariff</strong>, 
  the <strong>Tariff of 1816</strong>,<strong> </strong>primarily for <strong>protection for American companies</strong>.&nbsp; British 
  companies<strong> </strong>were trying to put American factories out of business by selling their 
  British goods for much less than the American factories.&nbsp; The tariff placed a <strong> 20-25% tax</strong> on the value of dutiable imports.&nbsp; This tax increased over time, creating problems of no competition between companies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Henry Clay</u> created a plan for developing a profitable U.S. economy.&nbsp; It was called the <strong>American System</strong>.&nbsp; It had<strong> 3 main parts</strong>: </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:10px">1) A <strong>strong banking system</strong> that would provide easy and abundant credit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:10px">2) A<strong> protective tariff</strong> that would allow eastern manufacturing to flourish.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:10px">3) A <strong>network of roads and canals</strong> that would transport raw materials across the country.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>President Madison</u><strong> </strong>vetoed a bill to give <strong> states aid for infrastructure,</strong> deeming it unconstitutional. The 
  Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans were opposed to using federal money to support interstate improvements. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The So-Called Era of Good Feelings</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Federalists ran a presidential candidate for the last time in <strong>1816</strong>.&nbsp; <u>James Monroe</u> won the election.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The time during the administrations of President Monroe was 
known as the "<b>Era of Good Feelings</b>" because the 2 political parties were 
getting along.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Panic of 1819 and the Curse of Hard Times</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Panic of 1819</strong> was the first financial panic 
  since President Washington took office.&nbsp; The main cause was <strong>over-speculation </strong>in frontier lands.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Bank of the United States was hated by western farmers because it foreclosed on many farms.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Growing Pains of the West</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Between <strong>1791 and 1819</strong>, <strong>9</strong> states from the West 
  had joined the United States.&nbsp; People moved west because of cheap land, the construction of highways, and many Indian territories had been eliminated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <b>Land Act of 1820</b> authorized a buyer to purchase 
80 virgin acres at a minimum of $1.25 an acre.&nbsp; The West also demanded cheap 
transportation and cheap money.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Slavery and the Sectional Balance</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The House of Representatives passed the <strong>Tallmadge Amendment</strong>, making it more difficult for Missouri to become a state.&nbsp; It 
  did not allow for anymore slaves to be brought into Missouri and for the gradual 
  emancipation of children born to slave parents already in Missouri.&nbsp; The amendment was defeated by the slave states in Congress.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Peculiar Institution: an expression used to describe slavery and its economic impacts in the South</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Uneasy Missouri Compromise</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Henry Clay </strong>introduced a compromise that decided 
  whether or not Missouri would be admitted as a slave state.&nbsp; Congress decided to 
  admit <strong>Missouri</strong> as a<strong> slave state </strong>in <strong>1820. </strong>But, <strong>Maine</strong>, 
  which was apart of Massachusetts, was to be admitted as a separate, <strong>free 
    state</strong>.&nbsp; Therefore, there were 12 slave states and 12 free states.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <b>Missouri Compromise</b> by Congress forbade slavery 
in the remaining territories in the Louisiana Territory north of the line of 36Â° 
30', except for Missouri.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>James Monroe</u> was re-elected President<strong> </strong> in <strong>1820</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>John Marshall and Judicial Nationalism</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>McCulloch </em>vs.<em> Maryland </em>(1819) </strong>involved 
  an attempt by Maryland to destroy a branch of the Bank of the 
  United States by imposing a tax on the Bank's notes.&nbsp; <u>John Marshall</u> declared the U.S. Bank constitutional by invoking the Hamiltonian doctrine of 
  implied powers.&nbsp; He strengthened federal authority when he <strong>denied the right of Maryland to tax the Bank</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>Cohens </em>vs. </strong><em><strong>Virginia</strong></em><strong><em> </em> (1821) </strong>involved the Cohens appealing to the Supreme Court after being found 
  guilty of illegally selling lottery tickets in Virginia.&nbsp; <strong> Virginia won</strong> and the conviction was withheld, but the ruling further cemented the powers of the federal government.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>Gibbons </em>vs. </strong><em><strong>Ogden</strong></em><strong><em> </em> (1824) </strong>came up when New York tried to give a private company a monopoly of waterborne commerce between New York and New Jersey.&nbsp; 
  (Meaning that no other company could use the waterway.)&nbsp; <strong>New York lost.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Judicial Dikes Against Democratic Excesses</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>Fletcher </em>vs. <em>Peck </em>(1810):</strong> The Georgia 
  legislature granted 35 million acres to private speculators; the next 
  legislature cancelled the bribery-induced transaction.&nbsp; <u>John Marshall</u> let 
  the state give the acres to the private speculators calling it a contract and 
  constitutional. The decision protected property rights against popular 
  pressures.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>Dartmouth College </em>vs. <em>Woodward </em>(1819):</strong> Dartmouth College was given a charter by King George III but New Hampshire 
  wanted to take it away.&nbsp; John Marshall ruled in favor of the college.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Daniel Webster:</u> "Expounding Father"; served in both 
  the House and Senate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sharing Oregon and Acquiring 
Florida</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>John Quincy Adams:</u> Secretary of State to James 
  Monroe.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Angle-American Convention of 1818</strong> allowed the Americans to share 
  the Newfoundland fisheries with the Canadians and provided for a 10-year joint 
  occupation of the Oregon Country without a surrender of the rights/claims of 
  either America or Britain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the many revolutions taking place in South America, 
  Spain was forced to take many of its troops out of <strong>Florida</strong>.&nbsp; <u>General 
    Andrew Jackson</u> went into Florida saying he would <strong>punish the Indians and 
      recapture the runaways who were hiding away in Spanish Florida</strong>.&nbsp; He did 
  this and captured <strong>St. Marks and Pensacola</strong>, the 2 most important Spanish 
  posts in the area.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the <strong>Florida Purchase Treaty of 1819</strong>, Spain ceded 
  Florida and Spanish claims to Oregon in exchange for America's claims to Texas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Menace of Monarchy in America</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After Napoleon's defeat in 1815, the Europeans 
  wanted to completely <strong>eliminate democracy</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>George Canning:</u> British foreign secretary; asked the 
  American minister in London if the United States would band together with the 
  British in a <strong>joint declaration </strong>renouncing any interest in acquiring Latin 
  American territory, and specifically warning the European dictators to keep out of Latin America.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Monroe and His Doctrine</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Secretary Adams</u> thought the British feared that the 
  Americans would take Spanish territory in the Americas, ultimately threatening Britain's possessions in the Caribbean.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Monroe Doctrine (1823): </strong>President Monroe's warning to the European powers; its 
  two components were <strong>noncolonization </strong>and<strong> nonintervention</strong>; it had little immediate impact.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- Monroe stated that the era of colonization 
in the Americas was over.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- Monroe also warned against foreign 
  intervention.&nbsp; He warned Britain to stay out of the Western Hemisphere, and 
  stated that the United States would not intervene in foreign wars. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Monroe's Doctrine Appraised</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Europeans powers were offended </strong>by the Monroe 
  Doctrine. This was in part because of America's soft military strength.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Monroe was more concerned with the <strong>security of 
  America </strong>when he issued the Monroe Doctrine.&nbsp; He basically warned the Old 
  World powers to stay away.&nbsp; The<strong> Doctrine thrived off nationalism</strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Russo-American Treaty of 1824</strong>: the Russians retreated farther north into Alaska </p>

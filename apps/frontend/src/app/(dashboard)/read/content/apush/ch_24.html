<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Iron Colt Becomes an Iron Horse</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The country's railroad network significantly expanded in the late 1800s.
  Because of the high costs and risks associated with building railroads,
  Congress subsidized the cost of many railroad construction projects. Congress
  also gave a lot of unused public land to the railroad companies.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spanning the Continent with Rails</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In 1862, Congress selected the <strong>Union Pacific Railroad</strong> company
  to build a <strong>transcontinental railroad</strong> starting in Omaha,
  Nebraska.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>Central Pacific Railroad</strong> company was responsible to
  laying track on the California-side of the transcontinental railroad.&nbsp;
  The 4 chief financial backers of the Central Pacific Railroad (the<strong>
    Big Four</strong
  >) included <u>Leland Stanford</u> and <u>Collis P. Huntington</u>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Union Pacific Railroad and the Central Pacific Railroad companies both
  received financial aid from the government.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The transcontinental railroad was completed in <strong>1869</strong>, allowing
  for increased trade with Asia and opening up the West for expansion.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Binding the Continent with Railroad Ties</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  There were 5 transcontinental railroads built:&nbsp; The
  <strong>Northern Pacific Railroad</strong>, running from Lake Superior to
  Puget Sound, was completed in 1883; the <strong>Atchison</strong>,
  <strong>Topeka</strong>, and <strong>Santa Fe</strong>, running from Topeka to
  California, was completed in 1884; the <strong>Southern Pacific</strong>,
  stretching from New Orleans to San Francisco, was completed in 1884; and
  the<strong> Great Northern</strong>, running from Duluth to Seattle, was
  completed in <strong>1893</strong> by <u>James J. Hill</u>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Railroad Consolidation and Mechanization</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>Cornelius Vanderbilt</u> made lot of money improving the Eastern railroads.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  2 advancements helped the development of the railroads: the steel rail and a
  standard gauge of track width.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Revolution by Railways</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The railroad stimulated the industrialization of the country in the post-Civil
  War years.&nbsp; It created an enormous domestic market for American raw
  materials and manufactured goods.&nbsp; Railroad companies also stimulated
  immigration.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Until the 1880s, every town in America had its own local time. &nbsp;To keep
  schedules and avoid wrecks, the major rail lines proposed, on
  <strong>November 18, 1883</strong>, dividing America into
  <strong>4 times zones</strong> - most towns accepted the new time method.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wrongdoing in Railroading</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Some people selling bonds for railroad companies inflated claims about the
  company's assets and profits, enabling them to sell stocks and bonds in excess
  of the railroad's actual value ("<strong>stock watering</strong>").
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Many railroad titans felt they were above the law, and they abused the public
  by bribing judges and legislatures.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Railroad kings were manipulators of a huge natural monopoly and exercised too
  much direct control over the lives of people.
</p>
<p>
  Railroad companies colluded with each other to protect their profits.&nbsp;
  "<strong>Pools</strong>" were agreements to divide the business in a given
  area and share the profits. Small farmers often paid the highest railroad
  transportation rates, while big customers paid low rates.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Government Bridles the Iron Horse</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  During the depression of the 1870s, farmers protested against railroaders who
  ran the farmers into bankruptcy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Many Midwestern legislatures tried to regulate the railroad monopoly, but in
  <strong>1886</strong>, the Supreme Court ruled in
  <strong
    ><em
      >Wabash, St. Louis &amp; Pacific Railroad Company vs. Illinois</em
    ></strong
  >
  that individual states could not regulate interstate commerce.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1887</strong>, Congress passed the
  <strong>Interstate Commerce Act</strong>.&nbsp; It prohibited rebates and
  pools, required the railroads to publish their rates openly, forbade unfair
  discrimination against shippers, and outlawed charging more for a short trip
  than for a long trip over the same line.&nbsp; It also created the
  <strong>Interstate Commerce Commission</strong> (ICC) to administer and
  enforce the new legislation.&nbsp; The new laws provided a forum where
  competing businesses could resolve their conflicts in peaceful ways (instead
  of engaging in price wars).
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Miracles of Mechanization</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>telephone</strong> was created in <strong>1876</strong> by
  <u> Alexander Graham Bell</u>.&nbsp; This invention revolutionized the way
  Americans communicated.&nbsp; <u>Thomas Alva Edison</u> invented numerous
  devices; the most well-known is the <strong>electric</strong>
  <strong>light</strong> <strong>bulb</strong> in <strong>1879</strong>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Trust Titan Emerges</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Tycoons like <u>Andrew Carnegie</u> (steel king),
  <u>John D. Rockefeller</u> (oil baron), and
  <u>J. Pierpont Morgan</u> (bankers' banker), circumvented their
  competition.&nbsp; Carnegie used the tactic of "<strong
    >vertical integration</strong
  >" to combine all phases of manufacturing into one organization.&nbsp; He and
  his business controlled every aspect of production, from mining to
  marketing.&nbsp; His goal was to improve efficiency.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  "<strong>Horizontal integration</strong>" meant allying with competitors to
  monopolize a given market.&nbsp; This tactic of creating trusts was used by
  Rockefeller.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Morgan used the tactic of <strong>interlocking directorates </strong>when he
  put his people on the boards of directors of rival companies
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Supremacy of Steel</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>Steel</strong> was "king" during the industrialization era; nearly
  every aspect of society used it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  By the late 1800s, the United States was producing 1/3 of the world's steel
  supply.&nbsp; The <strong>Bessemer process</strong> simplified the steel
  production process and reduced the price of steel. The process involved
  blowing cold air on red-hot iron to ignite the carbon and eliminate
  impurities.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Carnegie and Other Sultans of Steel</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>Andrew Carnegie</u> was not a monopolist and disliked monopolistic trusts.
  By 1900, he was producing Â¼ of the nation's Bessemer steel.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>J. P. Morgan</u> financed the reorganization of railroads, insurance
  companies, and banks.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In 1900, Carnegie wanted to sell his holdings of his steel companies. He
  threatened to ruin Morgan's steel pipe production business if Morgan did not
  buy him out. &nbsp;Morgan bought out Carnegie for
  <strong>$400 million</strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Morgan created the <strong> United States Steel Corporation</strong> in
  <strong>1901</strong>.&nbsp; It was America's first billion-dollar
  corporation.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Carnegie dedicated the rest of his life to donating his money to charities.
</p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Rockefeller Grows an American Beauty Rose</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>Kerosene</strong> was the first major product of the oil industry.
  &nbsp;The invention of the electric light bulb made kerosene obsolete.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  By 1900, the gasoline-burning <strong>internal</strong>
  <strong>combustion</strong> <strong>engine</strong> became the primary means
  of automobile propulsion.&nbsp; The birth of the automobile gave a great lift
  to the oil industry.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>John D. Rockefeller</u> created the
  <strong>Standard Oil Company of Ohio </strong>in <strong>1870</strong>,
  attempting to eliminate the middlemen and knock out his competitors.&nbsp; By
  1877, he controlled 95% of all the oil refineries in the
  nation.&nbsp;Rockefeller expanded his company by eliminating his competitors.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Other trusts came about in America. These included the sugar trust, the
  tobacco trust, the leather trust, and the harvester trust.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Gospel of Wealth</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The wealthy used "survival of the fittest" to explain why they were
  financially successful and why poor people were poor.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>Plutocracy</strong>: when a government is controlled by the wealthy.
  The Constitution gave Congress sole jurisdiction over interstate commerce.
  This enabled monopolists to use their lawyers to thwart controls by state
  legislatures. Large trusts also sought safety behind the 14<sup>th</sup>
  Amendment, arguing that corporations were actually legal "people."
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Government Tackles the Evil Trust</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Congress passed the <strong>Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890</strong>, which
  forbade business activities that the government deemed as anti-competitive. It
  also required the government to investigate trusts. The law was ineffective
  because it contained legal loopholes and it made all large trusts suffer, not
  just the bad ones.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The South in the Age of Industry</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  As late as 1900, the South still produced fewer goods than it had before the
  Civil War. Southern agriculture received a boost in the 1880s when
  machine-made cigarettes replaced hand-made cigarettes.&nbsp; This increased
  tobacco consumption.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>James Buchanan Duke</u> created the <strong>American Tobacco</strong>
  <strong>Company</strong> in <strong> 1890</strong>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Many obstacles slowed southern industrialization.&nbsp; Northern-dominated
  railroad companies charged lower rates on manufactured goods moving southward
  from the North, but higher rates when raw materials were shipped from the
  South to the North.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The "<strong>Pittsburgh plus</strong>" pricing system was economic
  discrimination against the South in the steel industry. &nbsp;Deposits of coal
  and iron ore were discovered in Birmingham, Alabama. This should have helped
  Southern steel manufacturers, but Northern steel companies put pressure on the
  railroads to increase their shipping rates. This removed Birmingham's economic
  advantage.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The South excelled in manufacturing <strong>cotton textiles</strong>.&nbsp;
  Cotton mills were eventually created in the South, but they paid workers
  extremely low wages.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>The Impact of the New Industrial Revolution on America</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Economic developments after the Civil War increased the standard of living in
  the United States.&nbsp; The agriculture industry was replaced by
  manufacturing.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Women</b> were most affected by the new industrial age.&nbsp; Women found
  jobs as inventions arose; the typewriter and the telephone switchboard gave
  women new economic and social opportunities.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The nation of farmers and independent producers was becoming a nation of wage
  earners.&nbsp; By the beginning of the 1900s, the vast majority of the
  nation's population earned wages.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>In Unions There Is Strength</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  New machines displaced employees, but more jobs were created than destroyed in
  the long run.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Low wages conditions caused some factory workers to go on strike. Corporations
  sometimes forced their workers to sign "<strong>ironclad oaths</strong>" or
  "<strong>yellow-dog</strong> <strong>contracts,</strong>" stating that the
  workers would not join a labor union.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Some companies owned the "company town," increasing the prices of basic living
  expenses so that the company could make more money (grocery stores, banks,
  etc).
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Strikes became commonplace and the middle-class public started to get annoyed
  by them.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Labor Limps Along</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Civil War gave a boost to labor unions.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>National Labor Union</strong>, organized in <strong>1866</strong>,
  lasted 6 years and attracted 600,000 members. The purpose of the union was to
  organize workers across different trades and challenge companies for better
  working conditions. Black workers formed their own <strong>Colored</strong>
  <strong>National</strong> <strong>Labor</strong> <strong>Union</strong>.&nbsp;
  The Colored National Labor Union could not work with the National Labor Union
  because the latter supported the Republican Party and it was supported by
  racist white unionists.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  After the National Labor Union died out in 1877, the
  <strong>Knights of Labor</strong> took over. It was led by Terence V.
  Powderly, and it was started as a secret society. It sought to include all
  workers, while campaigning for economic and social reform, including and codes
  for safety and health.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Unhorsing the Knights of Labor</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  On <strong>May 4, 1886</strong> in <strong>Haymarket Square</strong>, Chicago
  police tried to break up a protest against alleged police brutalities. Someone
  threw a dynamite bomb, killing several people.&nbsp; 8 anarchists were
  convicted; 5 were sentenced to death while the other 3 were sent to
  jail.&nbsp; In <strong>1892</strong>, the governor of Illinois,
  <u>John P. Altgeld</u>, pardoned the 3 who were in prison.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Knights of Labor was blamed for the incident at Haymarket Square and as a
  result, it lost public support.&nbsp; Another problem with the Knights of
  Labor was that it included both skilled and unskilled workers. When unskilled
  workers went on strike, they were just replaced.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>American Federation of Labor</strong>'s inclusion of only skilled
  worked drained the Knights of Labor of its members.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The AF of L to the Fore</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>American Federation of Labor</strong> was founded in
  <strong> 1886</strong> and was led by <u>Samuel Gompers</u>.&nbsp; The
  federation was an association of self-governing unions, each of which kept its
  own independence.&nbsp; It sought for better wages, hours, and working
  conditions.&nbsp; The federation's main weapons were the walkout and the
  boycott. It supported the idea of<strong> closed shop</strong>, in which an
  employer could only hire union employees and all of the employees had to be in
  a union.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The greatest weakness of organized labor was that it was accepted by a small
  minority of working people.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Labor Day </b>was created by Congress in <b>1894</b>.

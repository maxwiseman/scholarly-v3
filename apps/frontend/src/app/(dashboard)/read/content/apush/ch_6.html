<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<h4>The Duel for North America</h4>
<h4>1608-1763</h4>
<hr />
<p>
  In the late 1600's and early 1700's, Spain, England, and France fought over
  territory in North America. The four big wars were: King William's War, Queen
  Anne's War, King George's War, and the French and Indian War.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>France Finds a Foothold in Canada</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1598</b>, the <b>Edict of Nantes</b> was issued by the crown of
  France.&nbsp; It granted limited religious freedom to French Protestants, and
  stopped religious wars between the Protestants and Catholics.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1608</b>, France established <b>Quebec</b>. The leading figure was
  <u>Samuel de Champlain,</u> an intrepid soldier and explorer whose energy and
  leadership earned him the title "Father of New France".
</p>
<p>
  The government of New France (Canada) was under direct control of the
  king.&nbsp; The people did not elect any representative assemblies.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>New France Sets Out</b></p>
<p>New France contained one valuable resource - <b>beaver</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  French Catholic missionaries, notably the <b>Jesuits</b>, tried to convert the
  Indians to Christianity and to save them from the fur trappers.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Antoine Cadillac</u>- founded Detroit in <b>1701</b> to thwart English
  settlers from pushing into the Ohio Valley.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Robert de La Salle</u>- explored the Mississippi and Gulf basin, naming it
  Louisiana.
</p>
<p>
  In order to block the Spanish at the Gulf of Mexico, the French placed several
  fortifications in Mississippi and Louisiana.&nbsp; The French founded
  <b>New Orleans</b> in <b>1718</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Illinois became France's garden empire of North America because much grain was
  produced there.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Clash of Empires</b></p>
<p>
  The early battles between the Europeans for control over North America were
  mostly between British and French colonists. At this time, neither European
  power saw North America as a place worth devoting significant military
  resources. The British colonists referred to these conflicts as
  <b>King William's War (1689-1697) </b>and <b>Queen Anne's War (1702-1713)</b>.
  The wars ended in <b>1713</b> with peace terms signed at
  <b> Utrecht</b>.&nbsp; France was terribly beaten in these conflicts, and
  Britain received French-populated Acadia and Newfoundland and the Hudson
  Bay.&nbsp; The British also won limited trading rights in Spanish America.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>War of Jenkins's Ear</strong> started in <b>1739</b> between the
  British and Spanish. This small battle became a war and became known as
  <b> King George's War in America.</b>&nbsp; It ended in <b>1748</b> with a
  treaty that handed Louisbourg back to France (allied with Spain), enraging the
  victorious New Englanders.

<p><b>George Washington Inaugurates War with France</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1754</b>, George Washington was sent to the Ohio Valley to secure land
  that had been purchased by some Virginians.&nbsp; His 150 Virginian militia
  killed the French leader, causing French reinforcements to come.&nbsp; The
  Virginians were forced to surrender on <b>July 4, 1754.</b>
</p>
<p>
  The increase in conflict caused the British in Nova Scotia to worry that the
  French in Acadia would attack them. So in <b>1755</b>, the British in Nova
  Scotia attacked and defeated the French <strong>Acadians </strong>and
  scattered them as far as Louisiana.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Global War and Colonial Disunity</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>French and Indian War </b>started in<b> 1754. </b>It was the American
  theater of the <b>Seven Years' War</b>. This war was fought in America,
  Europe, the West Indies, the Philippines, Africa, and on the ocean.
</p>
<p>
  In Europe, the principal adversaries were Britain and Prussia on one side.
  France, Spain, Austria, and Russia were on the other side.&nbsp; The French
  wasted so many troops in Europe that they were unable to put enough forces
  into America.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Albany Congress </b>met in<b> 1754. </b>&nbsp;Only 7 of 13 colony
  delegates showed up.&nbsp; It attempted to unite all of the colonies, but the
  plan was hated by individual colonists and the London regime.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Braddock's Blundering and Its Aftermath</b></p>
<p>
  <u>General Braddock</u> set out in <b>1755</b> with 2,000 men to capture
  <b>Fort Duquesne</b>.&nbsp; His force was slaughtered by the much smaller
  French and Indian army.&nbsp; (<b>Braddock's Blunder</b>)&nbsp; Due to this
  loss of troops, the whole frontier from Pennsylvania to North Carolina was
  left open to attack. George Washington, with only 300 men, tried to defend the
  area.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1756</b>, the British launched a <b>full-scale invasion of Canada</b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Pitt's Palms of Victory</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1757</b>, <u>William Pitt</u> became a prominent leader in the London
  government.&nbsp;He started to take control of British military leadership in
  North America. He attacked and captured <b>Louisbourg </b>in <b>1758</b>.
</p>
<p>
  To lead the attack in the <b>Battle of Quebec </b>in <b> 1759</b>, Pitt chose
  <u>James Wolfe</u>.&nbsp; The French and British armies faced each other on
  the <b>Plains of Abraham</b>, with the British lead by Wolfe and the French
  lead by <u>Marquis de Montcalm</u>.
</p>
<p>
  Montreal fell in <b>1760</b>. The <b>Treaty of Paris (1763)</b> ended the
  battle and threw the French off the continent of North America. Out of this
  conflict, the British became the dominant power in North America.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Restless Colonists</b></p>
<p>
  <b>Intercolonial disunity</b> had been caused by enormous distances;
  geographical barriers; conflicting religions, from Catholics to Quakers;
  varied nationalities, from German to Irish; differing types of colonial
  governments; many boundary disputes; and the resentment of the crude
  back-country settlers against the aristocrats.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>War's Fateful Aftermath</strong></p>
<p>
  In <b>1763</b>, <b>Ottawa chief</b>,<b> </b><u>Pontiac</u>,<b> </b>led several
  tribes, aided by a handful of French traders who remained in the region, in a
  violent campaign to drive the British out of the Ohio country.&nbsp; His
  warriors captured Detroit in the spring of that year and overran all but 3
  British outposts west of the Appalachians.
</p>
<p>The British countered these attacks and eventually defeated the Indians.</p>
<p>
  London government issued the <b>Proclamation of 1763. </b> &nbsp;It prohibited
  settlement in the area beyond the Appalachians.&nbsp; (The Appalachian land
  was acquired after the British beat the Indians).&nbsp; It was made to prevent
  another bloody eruption between the settlers and Indians.&nbsp; Many colonists
  disregarded it.

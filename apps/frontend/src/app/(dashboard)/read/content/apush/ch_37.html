<h3>Chapter 37</h3>
<h4>The Eisenhower Era</h4>
<h4>1952-1960</h4>
<hr />
<p><strong>Affluence and Its Anxieties</strong></p>
<p>
  The invention of the transistor in 1948 sparked a revolution in electronics,
  especially in <b>computers</b>.&nbsp; Computer giant International Business
  Machines (<b>IBM</b>) grew tremendously.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <b>Aerospace industries</b> grew in the 1950s, in large part due to
  Eisenhower's SAC and to an expanding passenger airline business.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1956</b>, the number of "<b>white-collar</b>" (no manual labor) workers
  exceeded the number of "<b>blue-collar</b>" (manual labor) workers.&nbsp;As a
  result, union memberships declined.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  White-collar jobs opened up opportunities for women. The majority of clerical
  and service jobs created after 1950 were filled by women. Women's new dual
  role as a worker and a homemaker raised questions about family life and about
  traditional definitions of gender roles.
</p>
<p>
  Feminist <u>Betty Friedan</u> published in <b>1963</b>
  <b><i>The Feminine Mystique</i></b
  >, helping to launch the modern women's movement.&nbsp; The book discussed the
  widespread unhappiness of women who were housewives.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Consumer Culture in the Fifties</b></p>
<p>
  The innovations of the credit card, fast-food, and new forms of recreation
  highlighted the emerging lifestyle of leisure and affluence.&nbsp; In 1946,
  there were only 6 TV stations, but there were 146 by 1956.
  "<b>Televangelists</b>" like Baptist <u>Billy Graham</u> used the TV to spread
  Christianity.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  As the population moved west, <b>sports</b> teams also moved west.&nbsp;
  Popular <b>music</b> was transformed during the 1950s.&nbsp;
  <u>Elvis Presley</u> created a new style known as <b>rock and roll</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Traditionalists were critical of Presley and many of the social movements
  during the 1950s.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Advent of Eisenhower</strong></p>
<p>
  Lacking public support for Truman, the Democrats nominated
  <u>Adlai Stevenson</u> for the<strong> election of 1952 </strong>and the
  Republicans nominated <u>Dwight D. Eisenhower</u>. Eisenhower was already
  well-liked by the public. <u>Richard M. Nixon</u> was chosen for
  vice-president to satisfy the anticommunist wing of the Republican Party.
  During this election, TV became a popular medium for campaigning.
</p>
<p>
  During the campaign, Nixon went on TV to defend himself against corruption
  allegations <b>"Checkers speech</b>".
</p>
<p><strong>Eisenhower won</strong> the election of 1952 by a large majority.</p>
<p>
  President Eisenhower attempted to end the Korean War.&nbsp; In
  <b>July 1953</b>, after Eisenhower threatened to use nuclear weapons, an
  <b>armistice</b> was signed, ending the Korean War.&nbsp; Despite the Korean
  War, Korea remained divided at the 38<sup>th</sup> Parallel.
</p>
<p>
  Eisenhower's leadership style of sincerity, fairness, and optimism helped to
  comfort the nation after the war.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Rise and Fall of Joseph McCarthy</b></p>
<p>
  In February 1950, <u>Republican Senator Joseph R. McCarthy</u> accused
  <u>Secretary of State Dean Acheson</u> of employing 205 Communist party
  members.&nbsp; Even though the accusations later proved to be false, McCarthy
  gained the support of the public. With the Republican victory in the election
  of 1952, his rhetoric became bolder as his accusations of communism grew.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>McCarthyism</strong>, the practice of spreading treasonous accusations
  without evidence, thrived during the Cold War. Though McCarthy was not the
  first red-hunter, he was the most ruthless.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1954</b>, McCarthy went too far and attacked the U.S. Army.&nbsp; Just a
  few months later, he was condemned by the Senate for "conduct unbecoming a
  member." (Army-McCarthy hearings)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Desegregating the South</b></p>
<p>
  All aspects of life of black life in the South were governed by the Jim Crow
  laws.&nbsp; Blacks were segregated from whites, economically inferior, and
  politically powerless. <u>Gunnar Myrdal</u> exposed the contradiction between
  America's professed belief that all men are created equal and its terrible
  treatment of black citizens in his book,
  <b><i>An American Dilemma</i></b> (<b>1944</b>).
</p>
<p>
  In <b><i>Sweatt v. Painter</i> </b>(<b>1950</b>), the Supreme Court ruled that
  separate professional schools for blacks failed to meet the test of equality.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>December 1955</b>, <u>Rosa Parks</u> refused to give up her seat to a
  white person on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama.&nbsp; Her arrest sparked a
  yearlong black boycott of the city buses (<strong
    >Montgomery bus boycott</strong
  >) and served notice throughout the South that blacks would no longer submit
  to segregation.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.</u> rose to prominence during the bus
  boycott.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Seeds of the Civil Rights Revolution</b></p>
<p>
  Hearing of the lynching of black war veterans in <b>1946</b>, President Harry
  Truman <b>ended segregation</b> in <b>federal civil service</b> and ordered
  "equality of treatment and opportunity" in the <b>armed forces</b> in
  <b>1948</b>.
</p>
<p>
  After Congress and new President Eisenhower ignored the racial issues,
  <u>Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren</u> stepped up to address civil
  rights for African Americans.
</p>
<p>
  In <b><i>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas</i></b> (<b>1954</b>),
  the Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public schools was unequal and,
  thus, unconstitutional.&nbsp; The decision reversed the previous ruling in
  <b><i>Plessy v. Ferguson </i></b>(<b>1896</b>).
</p>
<p>
  Southern states opposed the ruling. Congressmen from these states signed the
  "<b>Declaration of Constitutional Principles</b>" in <b>1956</b>, pledging
  their unyielding resistance to desegregation.
</p>
<p>
  President Eisenhower did not support integration because he shied away from
  social issues. In <b>September 1957</b>, <u>Orval Faubus</u>, the governor of
  Arkansas, used the National Guard to prevent 9 black students from enrolling
  in Little Rock's Central High School.&nbsp; Confronted with a direct challenge
  to federal authority, Eisenhower sent troops to escort the children to their
  classes.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1957</b>, Congress passed the first <b>Civil Rights Act</b> since
  Reconstruction Days.&nbsp; It set up a permanent
  <b>Civil Rights Commission</b> to investigate violations of civil rights and
  it authorized federal injunctions to protect voting rights.
</p>
<p>
  Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. formed the
  <b>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</b> (<b>SCLC</b>) in
  <b>1957</b>.&nbsp; It sought to mobilize the power of black churches on behalf
  of black rights.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  On <b>February 1, 1960</b>, 4 black college students in
  <b> Greensboro, North Carolina</b> demanded service at a whites-only lunch
  counter.&nbsp; Within a week, the sit-in reached 1,000 students, spreading a
  wave of wade-ins, lie-ins, and pray-ins across the South demanding equal
  rights.&nbsp; In April 1960, southern black students formed the
  <b>Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee</b> (<b>SNCC</b>) to give more
  focus to their efforts.

<p><b>Eisenhower Republicanism at Home</b></p>
<p>
  When dealing with people, President Eisenhower was liberal, but when dealing
  with the economy and the government, he was conservative.&nbsp; He strived to
  balance the federal budget and to guard America from socialism.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1954</b>, giving in to the Mexican government's worries that
  <b>illegal Mexican immigration</b> to the United States would undercut the
  <em>bracero</em> program of legally imported farmworkers, President Eisenhower
  deported a million illegal immigrants in <b>Operation Wetback</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Eisenhower tried to revert to the policy of assimilating Native American
  tribes into American culture,but his plan was dropped in <b>1961</b> after
  most tribes refused to comply.
</p>
<p>
  Eisenhower wanted to cancel New Deal programs, but he lacked pulic support to
  do so. He supported the <b>Federal Highway Act of 1956</b>, which created
  thousands of miles of federally-funded highways.
</p>
<p>
  Eisenhower only managed to balance the budget 3 times while in office (8
  years). In <b>1959</b>, he incurred the biggest <b>peacetime</b>
  <b> deficit</b> in the history of the United States.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A "New Look" in Foreign Policy</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1954</b>, secretary of state<u> John Foster Dulles</u> proposed a
  <strong>policy of boldness</strong> in which a fleet of superbombers would be
  built and equipped with nuclear bombs (called the
  <b>Strategic Air Command</b>, or <b>SAC</b>). This would allow the U.S. to
  threaten countries such as the Soviet Union and China with nuclear weapons.
</p>
<p>
  At the <b>Geneva summit conference in 1955</b>, President Eisenhower attempted
  to make peace with the new Soviet Union dictator, <u>Nikita Khrushchev</u>,
  following Stalin's death.&nbsp; Peace negotiations were rejected.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Vietnam Nightmare</b></p>
<p>
  In the early 1950s, nationalist movements tried to throw the French out of
  Vietnam. Vietnam leader <u>Ho Chi Minh</u> became increasingly communist while
  America became increasingly anticommunist.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  After the nationalists won at the <strong>Battle of Dien Bien Phu</strong> in
  <b>1954</b>, a peace was called. Vietnam was divided at the
  <b>17<sup>th</sup> parallel</b>. Ho Chi Minh was given the north, while a
  pro-Western government, led by <u>Ngo Dinh Diem</u>, was given the south. The
  Vietnamese nationalists were promised a nationwide election two years after
  the peace accords, but this never happened because it looked the communists
  would win.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Cold War Crises in Europe and the Middle East</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1955</b>, <b>West Germany</b> was let into <b>NATO</b>.&nbsp; Also in
  <b>1955</b>, the Eastern European countries and the Soviets signed the
  <b>Warsaw Pact</b>. This was a communist military union to counteract
  NATO.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In May 1955, the Soviets ended the occupation of Austria.&nbsp; In 1956,
  Hungary rose up against the Soviets attempting to win their
  independence.&nbsp; When their request for aid from the United States was
  denied, they were slaughtered by the Soviet forces.&nbsp; America's nuclear
  weapon was too big of a weapon to use on such a relatively small crisis.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1953</b>, in an effort to secure Iranian oil for Western countries, the
  CIA created a <strong>coup</strong> that installed
  <u>Mohammed Reza Pahlevi</u> as the dictator of <b>Iran</b>.
</p>
<p>
  <u>President Nasser</u> of <b>Egypt</b> sought funds from the West and the
  Soviets to build a dam on the Nile River. After the Americans learned of
  Egypt's involvement with the Soviets, the Americans withdrew their monetary
  offer. As a result, Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, which was owned by the
  French and British.&nbsp; In October of <b>1956</b>, the French and British
  attacked Egypt, starting the <b>Suez Crisis</b>.&nbsp; The two countries were
  forced to retreat after America refused to provide them with oil.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Eisenhower Doctrine</b>: a 1957 pledge of U.S. military and economic aid to
  Middle Eastern nations threatened by communist aggression.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1960</b>, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, and Venezuela joined
  together to form the
  <b>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</b> (<b>OPEC</b>).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Round Two for Ike</b></p>
<p>
  President Eisenhower decidedly beat his Democratic opponent,
  <u>Adlai Stevenson</u>, and he was reelected in the <b>election of 1956.</b>
</p>
<p>
  Fraud and corruption in American labor unions caused the president to take an
  interest in passing labor laws. In <b>1959</b>, President Eisenhower passed
  the <b> Landrum-Griffin Act</b>.&nbsp; It was designed to hold labor leaders
  more accountable for financial illegalities.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>October 4, 1957</b>, the Soviets launched the <b><i> Sputnik I</i></b
  ><i> </i>satellite into space.&nbsp; In November, they launched the satellite
  <b><i>Sputnik II</i></b
  >, carrying a dog.&nbsp; The two satellites gave credibility to Soviet claims
  that superior industrial production is achieved through communism.
</p>
<p>
  In response, President Eisenhower established the
  <b> National Aeronautics and Space Administration</b> (<b>NASA</b>).
</p>
<p>
  The technological advances in the Soviet Union made Americans think that the
  educational system of the Soviet Union was better than the United State's
  system. In <b>1958</b>, the
  <b>National Defense and Education Act</b> (<b>NDEA</b>) gave $887 million in
  loans to college students and in grants to improve teaching sciences and
  languages.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Continuing Cold War</b></p>
<p>
  Due to environmental concerns, the Soviet Union and the United States
  suspended nuclear tests in March and October 1958, respectively.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>July</b> <b>1958</b>, <b>Lebanon</b> called for aid under the Eisenhower
  Doctrine as communism threatened to take over the country.&nbsp; In
  <b>1959</b>, Soviet dictator Khrushchev appeared before the U.N. General
  Assembly and called for complete disarmament.&nbsp; In <b>1960</b>, an
  American <b>U-2 spy</b> <b>plane</b> was shot down in Russia, ending the
  possibility of an quick peaceful resolution.
</p>
<br />
<p><b>Cuba's Castroism Spells Communism</b></p>
<p>
  Latin Americans began to show dissent towards America as the United States
  seemed to neglect Latin America's economic needs in favor of Europe's.&nbsp;
  They also despised constant American intervention. In 1954, for example, the
  CIA led a coup that overthrew a leftist government in Guatemala.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Fidel Castro</u> led a coup that overthrew the American-supported
  government of <b>Cuba</b> in <b>1959</b>. Castro became militarily and
  economically allied with the Soviet Union; it had become a
  <b>military satellite</b> for the Soviet Union.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In August <b>1960</b>, Congress authorized $500 million to prevent communism
  from spreading in Latin America.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Kennedy Challenges Nixon for the Presidency</b></p>
<p>
  The Republicans nominated <u>Richard Nixon</u> to run for president and
  <u>Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.</u> for vice president in the election of
  <b>1960</b>.&nbsp; The Democrats nominated <u>John F. Kennedy</u> to run for
  president and <u>Lyndon B. Johnson</u> for vice president.
</p>
<p>
  John F. Kennedy's <b>Catholicism</b> irritated the Protestant people in the
  Bible Belt South.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Kennedy said that the Soviets, with their nuclear bombs and <i>Sputniks</i>,
  had gained on America's prestige and power.&nbsp; Nixon was forced to defend
  the existing administration (Republican) and claim that America's prestige had
  not slipped.
</p>
<p>
  Television played a key role in the presidential election as Kennedy's
  personal appeal attracted many people.&nbsp; <b>Kennedy</b> <b>won</b> the
  election of 1961, gaining support from workers, Catholics, and African
  Americans.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>An Old General Fades Away</b></p>
<p>
  America was economically prosperous during the Eisenhower years.&nbsp;
  <b> Alaska</b> and <b>Hawaii</b> became states in <b>1959</b>.&nbsp; As a
  Republican president, Eisenhower had helped integrate the reforms of the
  Democratic New Deal and Fair Deal programs into American life.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A Cultural Renaissance</b></p>
<p>
  <strong>New York </strong>became the
  <strong>art capital of the world</strong> after WWII.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Jackson Pollock</u> helped develop<strong> abstract expressionism</strong>
  in the 1940s and 1950s.
</p>
<p>
  American architecture also progressed after WWII. Many skyscrapers were
  created in a modernist or "<strong>International Style</strong>."
</p>
<p>
  Pre-war realist, <u>Ernest Hemingway</u> wrote
  <b><i>The Old Man and the Sea</i></b> (<b>1952</b>).&nbsp;
  <u>John Steinbeck</u>, another pre-war writer, wrote graphic portrayals of
  American society.&nbsp; <u>Joseph Heller's</u>
  <b><i> Catch-22</i></b> (<b>1961</b>) discussed the antics and anguish of
  American airmen in the wartime Mediterranean.
</p>
<p>
  The problems created by the new mobility and affluence of American life were
  explored by <u>John Updike</u> and <u>John Cheever</u>.&nbsp;
  <u> Louis Auchincloss</u> wrote about upper-class New Yorkers.&nbsp;
  <u>Gore Vidal</u> wrote a series of historical novels.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Poetry</b> and <b>playwrights</b> also flourished during the postwar
  era.&nbsp; Books by <b>black</b> <b>authors</b> made best-seller lists. Led by
  <u>William Faulkner</u>, the South also had a literary renaissance.

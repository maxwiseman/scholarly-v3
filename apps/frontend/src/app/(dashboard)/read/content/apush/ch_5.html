<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<h4>Colonial Society on the Eve of Revolution</h4>
<h4>1700-1775</h4>
<hr />
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Britain governed most of North America by 1775 (32 colonies), but only 13
  colonies had rebelled against the crown by this time. Canada, Jamaica, and
  others did not rebel. This was due to the social, economic, and political
  differences between the colonies.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Conquest by the Cradle</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Over the course of the 1700s, the population in the North American colonies
  exploded. By the end of the century, Britain no longer hadmore people than its
  colonies.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In 1775, the most populous colonies were Virginia, Massachusetts,
  Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Maryland.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">About 90% of people lived in rural areas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A Mingling of the Races</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Colonial America was a melting pot.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Germans were 6% </b>of the total population in 1775.&nbsp; Many Germans
  settled in Pennsylvania, fleeing religious persecution, economic oppression,
  and the ravages of war.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Scots-Irish were 7% </b>of the population in 1775.&nbsp; They were lawless
  individuals.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  By the mid 18<sup>th</sup> century, a series of Scots-Irish settlements were
  scattered along the <b>"great wagon road"</b>, which hugged the eastern
  Appalachian foothills from Pennsylvania to Georgia.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Scots-Irish led the armed
  <b>march of the Paxton Boys in Philadelphia in 1764</b>, protesting the Quaker
  oligarchy's lenient policy toward the Indians. A few years later, they led
  the<b> Regulator movement </b>in North Carolina, a small but nasty
  insurrection against eastern domination of the colony's affairs.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  About 5% of the multicolored colonial population consisted of other European
  groups- French Huguenots, Welsh, Dutch, Swedes, Jews, Irish, Swiss, and Scots
  Highlanders.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Structure of Colonial Society</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b
    >By the mid 1700s, the richest 10% of Bostonians and Philadelphians owned </b
  ><strong>2/3 of the taxable wealth</strong> in their cities.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  By 1750, Boston contained a large number of homeless poor, who were forced to
  wear a large red "P" on their clothing.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In all the colonies, the influx of indentured servants added to the population
  of the lower classes.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The black slaves were the lowest class in society.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clerics, Physicians, and Jurists</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  A position in the Christian ministry held the highest prestige.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Most physicians were poorly trained and not highly esteemed. The first medical
  school opened in 1765.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Epidemics were a constant nightmare.&nbsp; A crude form of inoculation was
  introduced in 1721.&nbsp; Powdered dried toad was a favorite prescription for
  smallpox.&nbsp; Diphtheria was also a killer, especially of young
  people.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lawyers were also not held in high regard.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Workday America</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Agriculture was the leading industry</b>, involving about 90% of the
  people.&nbsp; The staple crop in Maryland and Virginia was tobacco.&nbsp; The
  fertile middle (bread) colonies produced large quantities of grain.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Fishing was not nearly as prevalent as agriculture, but it was financially
  rewarding.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Trade was popular in the New England group - New York and Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong>Triangular Trade</strong>: a ship would leave a New England port with
  rum and sail to Africa. It would pick up slaves and then sail to the West
  Indies. It would pick up molasses and take this to New England where it would
  be converted to rum.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Manufacturing in the colonies was of only secondary importance.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Lumbering was the most important manufacturing activity. By 1770, about 1/3 of
  the British merchant marine was American built.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  As early as the 1730s, fast-breeding Americans demanded more and more British
  products-yet the slow growing British population early reached the saturation
  point for absorbing imports from America.&nbsp; This trade imbalance prompted
  the Americans to look for foreign markets to get money to pay for British
  products.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In 1773, bowing to pressure from British West Indian planters, Parliament
  passed the <b>Molasses Act</b>, aimed at crushing North American trade with
  the French West Indies.&nbsp; The colonists got around this by smuggling.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Horsepower and Sailpower</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The roadways in the colonies were in terrible condition.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  An intercolonial postal system was established by the mid-1700s.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dominant Denominations</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Two established, or tax-supported, churches were prominent in 1775: the
  <b>Anglican </b>and the <b>Congregational</b>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>Church of England</strong><strong> (Anglicans)</strong> became the
  official faith in Georgia, North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and a
  part of New York.&nbsp; The College of William and Mary was founded in 1693 to
  train a better class of clerics for the Anglican Church.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>Congregational Church</strong> had grown out of the Puritan
  Church, and was formally established in all the New England colonies except
  independent-minded Rhode Island.&nbsp; Presbyterianism was never made official
  in any of the colonies.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Religious toleration</b> had made tremendous strides in America.&nbsp;
  There were fewer Catholics in America; hence anti-Catholic laws were less
  severe and less strictly enforced.&nbsp; In general, people could worship or
  not worship as they pleased.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Great Awakening</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  A few churches grudgingly said that spiritual conversion was not necessary for
  church membership.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>Jacobus Arminius</u> was a Dutch theologian who preached that individual
  free will, not divine decree, determined a person's eternal fate
  (<strong>Arminianism</strong>). This challenged the Calvinist doctrine of
  predestination.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <b>Great Awakening</b> exploded in the 1730s and 1740s.&nbsp;The Awakening
  was started in Northampton, Massachusetts by <u>Jonathan Edwards</u>.&nbsp; He
  said that through faith in God, <b>not</b> through doing good works, could one
  attain eternal salvation.&nbsp; He had an alive-style of preaching.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>George Whitefield</u> gave America a different kind of enthusiastic type of
  preaching.&nbsp; The <b>old lights</b>, orthodox clergymen, were skeptical of
  the new ways of preaching.&nbsp; <b>New lights</b>, on the other hand,
  defended the Awakening for its role in revitalizing American religion.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Awakening had an emphasis on direct, emotive spirituality and seriously
  undermined the older clergy.&nbsp; It started many new denominations and
  greatly increased the numbers and the competitiveness of American churches.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Schools and Colleges</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Puritan New England was more interested in education than any other
  section.&nbsp; Dominated by the Congregational Church, it stressed the need
  for Bible reading by the individual worshipper.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  College education was regarded very highly in New England. In New England, the
  schools were focused on training men for the ministry.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  9 local colleges were established during the colonial era.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A Provincial Culture</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The red-bricked Georgian style was introduced in 1720.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Art &amp; architecture were popular in the colonies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Scientific progress in the colonies lagged behind progress in Britain.&nbsp;
  <u>Ben Franklin</u> was considered the only first-rank scientist in the New
  World.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Pioneer Presses</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  A celebrated legal case in 1734-1735 involved <u>John Peter Zenger</u>, a
  newspaper printer.&nbsp; He was charged with printing things that assailed the
  corrupt royal governor of New York.&nbsp; The jury voted him not guilty to the
  surprise of the judge and many people.&nbsp; This paved the way for freedom of
  the press.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Great Game of Politics</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  By 1775, 8 of the colonies had royal governors, who were appointed by the
  king.&nbsp; 3 of the colonies (Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware) were
  under proprietors who themselves chose the governors.&nbsp; 2 colonies
  (Connecticut and Rhode Island) elected their own governors under
  self-governing characters.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Nearly every colony used a two-house legislative body.&nbsp; The
  <strong>upper house</strong>, or council, was appointed by the crown in
  the<strong> royal colonies</strong> and by the proprietor in the
  <strong>proprietary colonies</strong>.&nbsp; The <strong>lower house</strong>,
  as the popular branch, was elected by the <strong>people</strong>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>Lord Cornbury</u>: made governor of New York and New Jersey in 1702.&nbsp;
  He was a drunkard, a spendthrift, and a bad person.

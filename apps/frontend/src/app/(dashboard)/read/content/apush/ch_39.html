<h3>Chapter 39</h3>
<h4>The Stalemated Seventies</h4>
<h4>1968-1980</h4>
<hr />
<p>
  <b>Sources of Stagnation</b>
</p>
<p>
  The growth of the American economy slowed down in the 1970s. More women and
  teens were entering the works force; these groups typically made less money
  than males. Deteriorating machinery and new regulations also hindered growth.
  The <b>Vietnam War</b> and on the <b>Great Society</b> program also
  contributed to inflation.
</p>
<p>
  Countries like Japan and Germany started to dominate industries that had
  traditionally been led by the Americans (steel, automobiles, and consumer
  electronics).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Nixon "Vietnamizes" the War</b></p>
<p>
  <u>President Nixon</u> brought knowledge and expertise in foreign affairs to
  the presidency. Nixon started a policy called "<b>Vietnamization</b>," which
  was to withdraw 540,000 U.S. troops from South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese,
  with American money, weapons, training, and advice, would then gradually take
  over the war. Nixon did not want to end the war; he wanted to win it by other
  means.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Nixon Doctrine:</b> the United States would honor its existing defense
  commitments but in the future, Asians and other countries would have to fight
  their own wars without the support of large numbers of American
  <strong>troops</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  On November 3, 1969, Nixon delivered a televised speech to the "<b
    >silent majority</b
  >," who presumably supported the war; he hoped to gain supporters.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Cambodianizing the Vietnam War</b></p>
<p>
  Cambodia, which was officially neutral in the war, bordered South Vietnam. The
  North Vietnamese had been using Cambodia as a springboard for troops, weapons,
  and supplies. On <b>April 29, 1970</b>, President Nixon ordered American
  forces to attack the enemy in <b>Cambodia</b>.&nbsp;Protests erupted at
  <strong>Kent State University</strong>, in which the National Guard shot 4
  students. Nixon withdrew the troops from Cambodia on <b>June 29, 1970</b>,
  although the bitterness between the "<b>hawks</b>" and the "<b>doves</b>"
  increased.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1971</b>, the <b>26<sup>th</sup> Amendment</b> was passed, lowering the
  voting age to 18.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Pentagon Papers</strong>: a leaked, top-secret Pentagon study that
  documented the deceptions of the previous presidential administrations, in
  regards to the Vietnam War.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Nixon's Détente with Beijing (Peking) and Moscow</b></p>
<p>
  The two great communist powers, the <b>Soviet Union </b>and <b>China</b>,
  disagreed over their interpretations of Marxism.&nbsp; Nixon and his national
  security advisor, <u>Dr. Henry A. Kissinger</u>, used the Chinese-Soviet
  tension to play off one country against the other. Nixon and Kissinger wanted
  to get the Soviet Union and China to pressure North Vietnam into peace.
</p>
<p>
  In 1972, Nixon visited China and paved the way for improved relations between
  the United States and Beijing.&nbsp; In May 1972, Nixon traveled to Moscow and
  negotiated <b>détente</b>, or relaxed tensions between the Soviet Union and
  China. The United States agreed to sell the Soviets at least $750 million
  worth of wheat, corn, and other cereals. Two agreements also slowed the arms
  race between America and the Soviets: 1) An
  <b>anti-ballistic missile </b> (<b>AMB</b>) <b>treaty</b> limited the U.S. and
  the Soviet Union to two clusters of defensive missiles. 2) <b>SALT </b>(<b
    >Strategic Arms Limitation Talks</b
  >) froze the numbers of long-range nuclear missiles for 5 years.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A New Team on the Supreme Bench</b></p>
<p>
  <u>Earl Warren</u> was appointed as a Justice to the Supreme Court in 1953 and
  he made many controversial rulings:
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i></b> (<b>1965</b>) struck down a state law
  that banned the use of contraceptives, even by married couples, creating a
  "right to privacy."
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>Gideon v. Wainwright</i></b> (<b>1963</b>) ruled that all criminals were
  entitled to legal counsel, even if they were unable to afford it.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>Escobedo </i></b>(<b>1964</b>) and <b><i>Miranda</i></b> (<b>1966</b>)
  ruled that those who were arrested had to the "right to remain silent."
  (<strong>Miranda warning</strong>)
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>Engel v. Vitale</i></b> (<b>1962</b>) and
  <b><i>School District of Abington Township vs. Schempp</i></b> (<b>1963</b>)
  ruled that public schools could not require prayers or Bible reading.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>Reynolds vs. Sims</i></b> (<b>1964</b>) ruled that the state
  legislatures would be required to be reapportioned according to population.
</p>
<p>
  In an attempt to end the liberal rulings, President Nixon set
  <u>Warren E. Burger</u> to replace the retiring Earl Warren in
  <b>1969</b>.&nbsp; The Supreme Court had four new Nixon-appointed members by
  the end of 1971.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Nixon on the Home Front</b></p>
<p>
  Nixon expanded the Great Society programs by increasing funding for
  <b>Medicare</b>, <b>Medicaid</b>, and
  <b>Aid to Families with Dependent Children</b> (AFDC).&nbsp; He also created
  the <b>Supplemental Security Income</b> (SSI), giving benefits to the poor
  aged, blind, and disabled.
</p>
<p>
  Nixon's <b>Philadelphia Plan of 1969</b> required construction-trade unions to
  establish quotas for hiring black employees.&nbsp; This plan changed the
  definition of "<b>affirmative action</b>" to include preferable treatment on
  <i>groups</i>, not <i>individuals</i>; the Supreme Court's ruling on
  <b><i>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</i></b> (<b>1971</b>) upheld this.&nbsp; Whites
  protested this decision, calling it "reverse discrimination."
</p>
<p>
  Nixon created the <b>Environmental Protection Agency</b> (<b>EPA</b>), the
  <b>Occupational Health and Safety Administration</b> (<b>OHSA</b>), and the
  <strong>Consumer Product Safety Commission</strong> (<strong>CPSC</strong>).
  These agencies gave the federal government more control over businesses.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1962</b>, <u>Rachel Carson's</u> book
  <b><i>Silent Spring</i></b> exposed the harmful effects of pesticides.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Clean Air Act of 1970</b> and the
  <b>Endangered Species Act of 1973</b> both aimed at protecting and preserving
  the environment.
</p>
<p>
  Worried about <b>inflation</b>, Nixon imposed a 90-day wage freeze and then
  took the nation off the gold standard (devaluing the dollar). This ended the
  "<b>Bretton Woods</b>" system of international currency stabilization, which
  was the agreement that each country would tie its monetary exchange rate to
  gold.
</p>
<p>
  Nixon's <strong>southern strategy</strong> helped him win the Southern vote.
  This strategy consisted of opposing civil rights for African-Americans.
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>The Nixon Landslide of 1972</b></p>
<p>
  In the spring of 1972, the North Vietnamese burst through the demilitarized
  zone separating the two Vietnams.&nbsp; Nixon ordered massive bombing attacks
  on strategic centers, halting the North Vietnamese offensive.
</p>
<p>
  Senator <u>George McGovern </u>won the 1972 Democratic nomination.&nbsp; He
  based his campaign on pulling out of Vietnam in 90 days.&nbsp;
  <u> President Nixon</u>, though, <b>won</b> the <b>election of 1972</b> in a
  landslide.
</p>
<p>
  Nixon ordered a two-week bombing campaign of North Vietnam in an attempt to
  force the North Vietnamese to the peace table.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>January 23, 1973</b>, North Vietnamese negotiators agreed to a
  <b>cease-fire agreement</b>.&nbsp; This agreement was really just a disguised
  American retreat.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Secret Bombing of Cambodia and the War Powers Act</b></p>
<p>
  Despite assurances to the American public that <b>Cambodia</b>'s neutrality
  was being respected, it was discovered that secret bombing raids on North
  Vietnamese forces in Cambodia had taken place since March of 1969; this caused
  the public to question trust of the government.&nbsp; Nixon ended the bombings
  in June 1973.
</p>
<p>
  Cambodia was taken over by the cruel dictator <u>Pol Pot</u>, who later
  committed genocide of over 2 million people over a span of a few years.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>November 1973</b>, Congress passed the <b>War Powers Act</b>. It
  required the president to tell Congress within 48 hours about all commitments
  of U.S. troops to foreign conflicts.&nbsp; A new feeling of "<b
    >New Isolationism</b
  >" that discouraged U.S. troops from being used in other countries' wars began
  to take hold.

<p><b>The Arab Oil Embargo and the Energy Crisis</b></p>
<p>
  During the <strong>Yom Kippur War</strong> in 1973, Syria and Egypt tried to
  regain the territory that they had lost to Israel during the
  <b>Six-Day War</b>. American support helped Israel win the war, but it caused
  the Arab nations (OPEC) to impose an oil embargo on the United States.&nbsp;
  To conserve oil, a<b> speed limit</b> of 55 MPH was imposed. An
  <b>oil pipeline</b> in <b>Alaska</b> was approved in <b>1974</b> and other
  forms of energy were researched.
</p>
<p>
  The embargo caused an economic recession in America and several other
  countries.
</p>
<p>
  <b>OPEC</b> (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) lifted the embargo
  in <b>1974</b>, but it quadrupled the price of oil.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Watergate and the Unmaking of a President</b></p>
<p>
  On <b>June 17, 1972</b>, five men working for the
  <b>Republican Committee for the Re-election of the President</b> were caught
  breaking into the Watergate Hotel and bugging Democrats' rooms. After the
  <strong>Watergate Scandal</strong>, it was discovered that the Nixon
  administration was involved in many other cases of corruption and "dirty
  tricks."
</p>
<p>
  Many prominent members of the President's administration resigned. Vice
  President
  <u>Spiro Agnew</u> was also forced to resign for taking bribes.&nbsp;Congress
  replaced Agnew with <u>Gerald Ford</u>.
</p>
<p>
  A select Senate committee, headed by Senator <u>Sam Erving</u>, led an
  investigation into the corruption. Nixon claimed no knowledge of the illegal
  activities, but <u>John Dean III</u>, a former White House lawyer, testified
  about how Nixon tried to cover up the Watergate Scandal.
</p>
<p>
  On October 20, 1973 ("<b>Saturday Night Massacre</b>"), Nixon fired
  <u>Archibald Cox</u>, the prosecutor of the Watergate Scandal case who had
  issued a subpoena of the tapes.&nbsp; The attorney general and deputy attorney
  general resigned because they did not want to fire Cox.
</p>
<p>
  When conversations involving the Watergate Scandal were discovered on
  <b>tapes</b>, President Nixon refused to hand them over to Congress, despite
  denying any participation in the scandal. On <b>July 24, 1974</b>, the Supreme
  Court ruled that President Nixon had to submit all tapes to Congress.&nbsp; On
  <b>August 5, 1974</b>, Nixon released the three tapes that held the most
  damaging information. One of the tapes (<strong>"smoking gun" tape</strong>)
  proved that Nixon had played an active part of the attempted cover-up of the
  Watergate Scandal.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>August 8, 1974</b>, <b>Nixon</b> <b>resigned</b> due to pressures from
  his own party.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>The First Unelected President</b>
</p>
<p><u>Gerald Ford</u> became the first unelected president.</p>
<p>
  President Ford's popularity and respect sank when he issued a
  <b>full pardon of Nixon</b>, thus setting off accusations of a "buddy deal."
</p>
<p>
  In <b>July 1975</b>, Ford signed the <b>Helsinki accords</b>, which recognized
  Soviet boundaries and helped to ease tensions between the two nations.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Defeat in Vietnam</b></p>
<p>
  Early in <b>1975</b>, the <b>North Vietnamese</b>
  <b>invaded South Vietnam</b>.&nbsp; President Ford request aid for South
  Vietnam, but was rejected by Congress.&nbsp; South Vietnam quickly fell.&nbsp;
  The last Americans were evacuated on <b>April 29, 1975</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The estimated cost to America was $188 billion, with 56,000 dead and 300,000
  wounded.&nbsp; America had lost face in the eyes of foreigners, lost its own
  self-esteem, lost confidence in its military power, and lost much of the
  economic strength that had made possible its global leadership after WWII.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Feminist Victories and Defeats</strong></p>
<p>
  In 1972, Congress passed
  <strong>Title IX of the Education Amendments</strong>, prohibiting sex
  discrimination in any federally assisted educational program. Congress
  approved the <strong>Equal Rights Amendment</strong> (<strong>ERA</strong>)
  amendment to the Constitution, although it was never ratified by enough
  states. This amendment would have prohibited laws that discriminated based on
  sex.
</p>
<p>
  In <em><strong>Roe vs. Wade</strong></em> (1973), the Supreme Court
  invalidated laws banning abortion.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Seventies in Black and White</strong></p>
<p>
  In <b>1974</b>, the Supreme Court ruled in
  <b><i>Milliken v. Bradley</i></b> that desegregation plans could not require
  students to move across school-district lines.&nbsp; This reinforced the "<b
    >white flight</b
  >".
</p>
<p>
  In 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in
  <b
    ><i>
      <span style="color: black">University of California v. Bakke</span></i
    ></b
  >
  that <u>Allan Bakke</u> that universities could not favor applicants based on
  the quality of race. The Supreme Court's only black justice,
  <u>Thurgood Marshall</u>, warned that the denial of racial preferences might
  erase the progress gained by the civil rights movement.
</p>
<p>
  In <em><strong>United States vs. Wheeler</strong></em> (1978), the Supreme
  Court ruled that Native American tribes had limited sovereignty.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Bicentennial Campaign</b></p>
<p>
  In the election of <b>1976</b>, Democrat <u>Jimmy Carter</u> beat Republican
  <u> Gerald Ford</u> to win the presidency.&nbsp; Carter promised to never lie
  to the American public.
</p>
<p>Carter was inexperienced in dealing with the politics of Washington.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Carter's Humanitarian Diplomacy</b>
</p>
<p>
  President Carter mediated peace talks between Israel and Egypt. On
  <b>September 17, 1978</b>, <u>President Anwar Sadat</u> of <b>Egypt</b> and
  <u>Prime Minister Menachem Begin</u> of <b>Israel</b> signed
  <b>peace accords</b> at Camp David. Israel agreed to withdraw from territory
  it had gained in the 1967 war as long as Egypt respected Israel's territories.
</p>
<p>
  President Carter pledged to return the <b>Panama Canal</b> to Panama by the
  year 2000 and resume full diplomatic relations with China in 1979.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Economic and Energy Woes</b>
</p>
<p>
  The <b>rate of inflation</b> had been steadily rising, and by <b>1979</b>, it
  was at <b>13%</b>.&nbsp; Americans learned that they were no longer
  economically isolated from the world.
</p>
<p>
  To reduce America's costly dependence on foreign oil, Carter called for
  legislation to improve energy conservation. The legislation didn't get much
  public support.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1979</b>, <b>Iran's</b> shah <u>Mohammed Reza Pahlevi,</u> who had been
  installed by America in 1953 and had ruled Iran as a dictator, was overthrown
  and succeeded by the <u>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</u>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Iranian fundamentalists were very opposed Western customs, and because of
  this, Iran stopped exporting oil. OPEC also raised oil prices and caused
  another <b> oil crisis</b>.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>July</b> <b>1979</b>, Carter retreated to Camp David and met with
  hundreds of advisors to come up with a solution to America's problems. On
  <b>July 15, 1979</b>, Carter gave his <strong>malaise speech</strong> in which
  he <b>chastised</b> the <b>American</b> <b>people</b> for their obsession of
  <b>material goods</b>, stunning the nation.&nbsp; A few days later, he fired
  four cabinet secretaries.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <b>Foreign Affairs and the Iranian Imbroglio</b>
</p>
<p>
  In 1979, Carter signed the <b>SALT II agreements</b> with Soviet leader<b>
    Leonid Brezhnev</b
  >, but the U.S. senate refused to ratify it.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>December 27, 1979</b>, the Soviet Union invaded <b>Afghanistan</b>,
  which ended up turning into the Soviet Union's version of Vietnam. Because
  Afghanistan bordered Iran, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan posed a threat
  to America's oil supplies.&nbsp; President Carter placed an embargo on the
  Soviet Union and boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow.&nbsp; He also proposed
  a "<b>Rapid Deployment Force</b>" that could quickly respond to crises
  anywhere in the world.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>November 4, 1979</b>, a group of anti-American Muslim militants stormed
  the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took hostages, demanding that the U.S. return
  the exiled shah who had arrived in the U.S. two weeks earlier for cancer
  treatments.
</p>
<p>
  To resolve the <b>Iranian Hostage Crisis</b>, Carter first tried
  <b> economic sanctions</b> on Iran; this did not work. He then tried a
  <b>commando</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>mission</b>, but that had to be
  aborted.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The hostage crisis dragged on for most of Carter's term, and the hostages were
  not released until <b>January 20, 1981</b> - the inauguration day of
  <u>Ronald Reagan</u>.

<p class="MsoNormal">The South and the Slavery Controversy</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1793-1860</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the late 1700s, slavery was starting to die out, but the invention of the cotton gin 
  prompted plantation owners to keep their slaves to support the larger cotton harvests.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>"Cotton is King!"</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cotton accounted for half the value of all American exports after 1840. In the 1850s, Britain's most important manufactured item was cotton cloth. Britain imported 75% of its raw cotton from the South. Because of this, the South had a significant influence in Britain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Planter "Aristocracy"</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The South was more of an <strong>oligarchy, </strong>a 
  government ran by a few.&nbsp; The government was heavily affected by the planter 
  aristocracy. Southern aristocracy widened the gap between 
  the rich and poor because the aristocrats made governmental decisions in their favor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Southern plantation wife commanded the female slaves.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Slaves of the Slave System</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The economic structure in the South became increasingly <strong> monopolistic</strong>.&nbsp; The Southern economy was very dependent on cotton, which made the economy unstable. Many plantation owners <strong>over-speculated </strong>in land and 
  slaves, causing them fall into debt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The White Majority</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The white population of the South was as follows (from smallest to largest): a) Wealthy slave owners. b) Less wealthy slave owners. These people didn't own a majority of the slaves, but they 
  made up a majority of the masters. c) Non-slave-holding whites (3/4 of 
  South white population). These whites supported slavery because they wanted to eventually own slaves and achieve the "<strong>American 
    dream</strong>" of moving up in society.&nbsp; The less prosperous non-slave-holding 
  whites were known as "poor white trash" and "hillbillies."&nbsp; Civilization hadn't reached mountain whites who lived in the valley of the Appalachian range. They supported Abraham Lincoln's Union party.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Free Blacks:&nbsp; Slaves Without Masters</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many free blacks settled in <b>New Orleans</b>.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Free blacks were generally not liked in the North and South. In the <strong>South</strong>, free blacks were prohibited from 
  having certain jobs and forbidden from testifying against whites in court.&nbsp; They 
  were known as the "<strong>3<sup>rd</sup> Race</strong>."&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">White southerners liked the black as an individual, but they hated the race.&nbsp; The white northerner professed to like the race, but disliked 
  the individual.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Plantation Slavery</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because the price of "<strong>black ivory</strong>" (slaves) was so 
  high, slaves were smuggled into the South even though legal importation of African 
  slaves into American ended in <strong>1808</strong>.&nbsp; Most slaves were the offspring of 
  slaves already in America.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Planters regarded slaves as major <b>investments</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Burdens of Bondage</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Slaves were not permitted to <b>read </b>because reading 
brought ideas and ideas brought discontent.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Slavery in the South was known as the "<strong>peculiar 
  institution</strong>."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Nat Turner's Rebellion</strong>: southern rebellion against slavery led by Nat Turner; the rebellion was defeated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Enslaved Africans aboard the slave ship <strong><em>Amistad</em></strong> rebelled and took control of the ship in 1839. The ship landed in Long Island, but the Africans were eventually returned to Sierra Leone. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Early Abolitionism</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>American Colonization Society</strong>: founded in 1817; 
  focused on transporting blacks back to Africa.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Republic of Liberia:</strong> founded in 1822 as a place for 
  former slaves.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By 1860, all southern slaves were born in America, and many did not have a desire to return to Africa. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Second Great Awakening inspired many 
  abolitionists to speak out against the sins of slavery.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The South Lashes Back</b> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From 1831-1832, Virginia defeated numerous emancipation bills. Other states followed suit, prohibiting all forms of emancipation. This series of emancipation setbacks was known as the <strong>nullification crisis of 1832</strong>. It silenced the voice 
  of white southern abolitionism.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Southerners argued that slavery was supported by the 
  Bible, and that slavery was good for the Africans because it introduced them to Christianity.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Abolitionist Impact in the North</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Abolitionists were, for a long time, unpopular in many 
  parts of the North.&nbsp; The southern planters owed much money to the northern 
  bankers. If the Union collapsed, these debts would not be repaid. Additionally, New England textile 
  mills were supplied with cotton raised by the slaves. If slavery was abolished, then 
  the cotton supply would be cut off, resulting in unemployment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"<b>Free soilers</b>" opposed extending slavery to the 
western territories.</p>

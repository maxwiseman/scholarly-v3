	<p>Chapter 14</p>
<p>Forging the National Economy</p>
<p>1790-1860</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Westward Movement</b></p>
<p>The life as a western <strong>pioneer</strong> was very grim. Pioneers were poor and stricken with disease and loneliness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Shaping the Western Landscape</b></p>
<p><strong>Fur trapping</strong> was a large industry in the Rocky 
  Mountain area.&nbsp; Each summer, fur trappers would meet with traders from the East to exchange <strong>beaver pelts </strong>for <strong> manufactured goods</strong> ("rendezvous" system).</p>
<p><u>George Caitlin:</u> painter and student of Native 
  American life who was one of the first Americans to advocate the preservation of 
  nature; proposed the idea of a<strong> national park</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The March of Millions</b></p>
<p>By the <b>mid-1800s</b>, the population was <b>doubling 
every 25 years</b>.&nbsp; By <b>1860</b>, there were <b>33</b> states and the U.S. 
was the 4<sup>th</sup> most populous country in the western world.</p>
<p>The increased population and larger cities brought about disease 
  and decreased living standards.</p>
<p>In the 1840s and 1850s, more European immigrants came to 
  the Americas because Europe seemed to be <strong>running out of room. </strong>Immigrants also came to America to escape the aristocratic caste and state church, and there was more opportunity to improve one's life. Transoceanic steamboats also reduced ocean travel times.</p>
<br><p><b>The Emerald Isle Moves West</b></p>
<p>In the <strong>1840s</strong>, the "<strong>Black Forties</strong>," many <strong> Irish</strong> came to America because of a <strong>potato rot</strong> that induced a famine through Ireland.&nbsp; Most of the Irish were Roman-Catholic.&nbsp; 
  They were politically powerful because they bonded together as one large voting 
  body. They increased competition for jobs, so they were hated by native workers.&nbsp; The Irish hated the blacks and the British.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The German Forty-Eighters</b></p>
<p>Between <strong>1830 and 1860</strong>, many <strong>Germans </strong>came to 
  America because of crop failures and other hardships (collapse of German democratic revolutions).</p>
<p>Unlike the Irish, the Germans possessed a modest amount of 
  material goods when they came to America. The Germans moved west into the Middle West (Wisconsin).</p>
<p>The Germans were more educated than the Americans, and they were 
  opposed to slavery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Flare-ups of Antiforeignism</b></p>
<p>The massive immigration of the Europeans to America 
  inflamed the <strong>prejudices </strong>of American <strong>nativists</strong>.&nbsp; The<strong> Roman 
    Catholics </strong>created an entirely separate Catholic educational system to avoid 
  the <strong>American Protestant </strong>educational system.</p>
<p> The American party (<strong>Know-Nothing party</strong>) was created by native Americans who opposed the immigrants. </p>
<p>Many people died in riots and attacks between the American natives and the immigrants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Creeping Mechanization</b></p>
<p>In <strong>1750</strong>, steam was used with machines to take the 
  place of human labor.&nbsp; This enabled the <strong>Industrial Revolution </strong>in <strong> England</strong>.</p>
<p>It took <strong>a while for the Industrial Revolution to spread to America </strong>because soil in America was cheap and peasants preferred to grow crops as 
  opposed to working in factories.&nbsp; Because of this, labor was scarce until the immigrants came to America in the 1840s.&nbsp; There was also a lack of investment money available in America. The large 
  British factories also had a monopoly on the textile industry, with which American companies could not compete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Whitney Ends the Fiber Famine</b></p>
<p><u>Samuel Slater:</u> "Father of the Factory System" in 
  America; escaped Britain with memorized plans for textile machinery; put 
  into operation the first machine to spin cotton thread in 1791.</p>
<p><u>Eli Whitney:</u> built the first <strong>cotton gin</strong> in <strong> 1793</strong>.&nbsp;The cotton gin was much more effective than slaves at separating the cotton seed from the cotton fiber. Its development affected the entire world. Because of the cotton gin, the South's production of cotton greatly increased and demand for cotton revived the demand for slavery.</p>
<p><strong>New England</strong> became the <strong>industrial center</strong> of the Industrial Revolution in America<strong>&nbsp;</strong>because it had poor soil for farming; it had a dense population for labor; 
  shipping brought in capital; seaports enabled the import of raw materials and 
  the export of the finished products.</p>

	<p><b>Marvels in Manufacturing</b></p>
<p>The <strong>War of 1812</strong> created a<strong> boom of American 
  factories </strong>and the use of American products as opposed to British imports.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The surplus in <strong>American manufacturing dropped </strong> following the <strong>Treaty of Ghent in 1815</strong>.&nbsp; The British manufacturers sold 
  their products to Americans at very low prices.&nbsp; Congress passed the <strong>Tariff 
    of 1816 </strong>to protect the American manufacturers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In 1798, <u>Eli Whitney</u> came up with the idea of using machines (instead of people) to make each part of the musket. This meant that the musket's components would be consistently manufactured, and thus, could be interchanged. The principle of <strong>interchangeable parts </strong>caught on by <strong>1850 </strong>and it became the basis for <strong>mass-production</strong>.</p>
<p><u>Elias Howe:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>invented the <strong>sewing machine </strong>in <strong>1846.</strong> The sewing machine boosted northern industrialization. It became the foundation of the ready-made clothing industry.</p>
<p>Limited Liability: an individual investor only risks his personal investment in a company in the event of a bankruptcy. </p>
<p><strong>Laws of "free incorporation": </strong>first passed in New 
  York in <strong>1848</strong>; enabled businessmen to create corporations without 
  applying for individual charters from the legislature.</p>
<p><u>Samuel F. B. Morse:</u> invented the <strong>telegraph</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Workers and "Wage Slaves"</b></p>
<p>Impersonal relationships replaced the personal 
relationships that were once held between workers.</p>
<p>Factory workers were<strong> forbidden by law to form labor 
  unions to raise wages</strong>.&nbsp; In the <strong>1820s</strong>, many <strong>children </strong>were used 
  as <strong>laborers </strong>in factories. &nbsp;Jacksonian democracy brought about the voting rights of 
  the laboring man.</p>
<p>President Van Buren established the <strong>ten-hour work day </strong>in <strong>1840</strong> (for federal employees on public projects).</p>
<p><strong><em>Commonwealth vs. Hunt:</em></strong> Supreme Court ruled that labor unions were not illegal conspiracies, provided that their 
  methods were honorable and peaceful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Women and the Economy</b></p>
<p>Farm <strong>women and girls </strong>had an important place in the 
  pre-industrial economy: spinning yarn, weaving cloth, and making candles, soap, 
  butter, and cheese.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Women were forbidden to form unions</b> and they had few 
opportunities to share dissatisfactions over their harsh working conditions.</p>
<p><u>Catharine Beecher:</u> urged women to enter the teaching 
  profession.</p>
<p>The vast majority of working women were single.</p>
<p><strong>Cult of Domesticity</strong>: a widespread cultural creed that glorified the customary functions of the homemaker. </p>
<p>During the <strong>Industrial Revolution</strong>, <strong>families</strong> <strong>were small</strong>, affectionate, and child-centered, which provided a special place for 
  women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Western Farmers Reap a Revolution in the Fields</b></p>
<p>The trans-Allegheny region, especially Indiana and Illinois, became the nation's <strong> breadbasket</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Liquor </strong>and <strong>hogs </strong>became the early western 
  farmer's <strong>staple market items </strong>because both of these items were supported by corn.</p>
<p><u>John Deere:</u> produced a <strong>steel plow</strong> in <strong>1837</strong> which broke through the thick soil of the West.</p>
<p><strong>McCormick Reaper</strong>: a horse-drawn mechanical reaper that could cut and gather crops much faster than with previous methods (i.e. hand-picking). This enabled larger-scale farming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Highways and Steamboats</b></p>
<p><strong>Lancaster Turnpike:</strong> hard-surfaced highway that ran 
  from Philadelphia to Lancaster; drivers had to pay a toll to use it.</p>
<p>In <b>1811</b>, the federal government began to construct 
the <b>National Road</b>, or <b>Cumberland Road</b>.&nbsp; It went from Cumberland, 
in western Maryland, to Illinois.&nbsp; Its construction was halted during the War of 
1812, but the road was completed in <b>1852</b>.</p>
<p><u>Robert Fulton:</u> installed a steam engine on a boat and thus, created 
  the first <strong>steamboat</strong>. The steamboat played a vital role in the economic expansion of the West and South, via their extensive waterways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>"Clinton's Big Ditch" in New York</b></p>
<p><u>Governor DeWitt Clinton:</u> governor of New York who 
  lead the building of the <strong>Erie Canal </strong>that connected the Great Lakes with 
  the Hudson River in <strong>1825</strong>; the canal lowered shipping prices and decreased 
  passenger transit time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Iron Horse</b></p>
<p>The most significant contribution to the expansion of the American economy was the <strong>railroad</strong>.&nbsp; The first one appeared in 1828.</p>
<p>Railroads were initially opposed because of safety flaws and because they took away money from the Erie Canal investors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Cables </b>(Telegraphs)<b>, Clippers, and Pony Riders</b></p>
<p>In the 1840s and 1850s, American navel yards began to produce 
  new ships called <strong>clipper ships</strong>.&nbsp; These ships sacrificed cargo room for 
  speed and were able to transport small amounts of goods in short amounts of 
  time.&nbsp; These ships were eventually superseded by steamboats after steamboats were improved.</p>
<p>The <b>Pony Express</b> was established in <b>1860 </b>to 
carry mail from St. Joseph, Missouri to Sacramento, California.&nbsp; The mail 
service collapsed after 18 months due to lack of profit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Transport Web Binds the Union</b></p>
<p>The<strong> transportation revolution </strong>was created because people in the east wanted to move west. </p>
<p>The South raised cotton for export to New England and 
  Britain.&nbsp; The West grew grain and livestock to feed factory workers in the East 
  and in Europe.&nbsp; The East made machines and textiles for the South and the West.&nbsp; 
  All of these products were transported using the railroad; the railroad <strong> linked</strong> America.</p>
<p><strong>The Market Revolution</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>market revolution</strong> transformed the American economy from one in which people subsisted on things they grew/created to one in which people purchased goods that were produced all over the country.</p>

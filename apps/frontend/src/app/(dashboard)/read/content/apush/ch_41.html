<p>America Confronts the Post-Cold War Era</p>
      
<p>1992-2011</p>
      
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> 
        <b>Bill Clinton: &nbsp;The First Baby-Boomer President</b></p>
      <p> 
        For the <b>election of 1992</b>, the Democrats chose <u>Bill Clinton</u> 
        as their candidate (despite accusations of womanizing and draft evasion) 
        and <u> Albert Gore, Jr.</u> as his running mate.&nbsp; The Democrats 
        tried a new approach, promoting growth, strong defense, and anticrime 
        policies, while campaigning to stimulate the economy.</p>
      
<p> 
  The Republicans dwelled on "family values" and re-nominated <u>George H. W. 
  Bush</u> for the presidency and <u>J. Danforth Quayle</u> for the vice presidency.</p>
      <p> 
        Third party candidate, <u>Ross Perot</u> entered the race and ended up 
        winning 19,237,247 votes, although he won no Electoral votes.&nbsp; </p>
      
<p> 
  <b>Clinton</b> <b>won</b> the election of 1992. Democrats also gained control 
  of both the House and the Senate.</p>
      
<p> 
  Presidency Clinton hired <b>minorities</b> and more <b>women</b> in Congress 
  and his presidential cabinet. This included the first female attorney general, 
  <u>Janet Reno</u>, Secretary of Health and Human Services, <u>Donna Shalala</u>, 
  and <u> Ruth Bader Ginsburg</u> in the Supreme Court</p>
      <p>&nbsp; 
      </p>
      <p> 
        <b>A False Start for Reform</b></p>
      
<p> 
  Clinton called for accepting homosexuals in the armed forces, but he had to 
  settle for a "<strong>don't ask, don't tell</strong>" policy that unofficially 
  accepted gays and lesbians.</p>
      
<p> 
  Clinton appointed his wife, <u>Hillary Rodham Clinton</u>, to revamp the nation's 
  health and medical care system.&nbsp; When the plan was revealed in October 
  1993, critics blasted it as cumbersome, confusing, and stupid.&nbsp; The previous 
  image of Hillary as an equal political partner of her husband changed to a liability.</p>
      
<p> 
  By <b>1998</b>, Clinton 's policies had led to <strong>budget surplus</strong> 
  and he had <b>shrunk</b> the <b>federal</b> <b>deficit</b> to its lowest levels 
  in ten years.&nbsp; </p>
      
<p> 
  On February 26, 1993, a radical Muslim group bombed the <b>World Trade Center</b> 
  in New York, killing six people.&nbsp; On April 19, 1993, a standoff at <b> 
  Waco, Texas</b> between the government and the <b>Branch Davidian cult </b> 
  ended in a fire that killed 82 people. On April 19, 1995, <u> Timothy McVeigh</u> 
  bombed a federal building in<strong> Oklahoma City</strong>, killing 169 people.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; 
      </p>
      <p> 
        <b>The Politics of Distrust</b></p>
      
<p> 
  In 1994, <u>Newt Gingrich</u> led Republicans on an attack of Clinton's liberal 
  failures with a conservative "<b>Contract with America</b>." &nbsp;That year, 
  Republicans won eight more seats in the Senate and 53 more seats in the House, 
  where Gingrich became the new Speaker of the House.</p>
      
<p> 
  A conservative Congress passed the <strong>Welfare Reform Bill</strong>, which 
  made cuts to welfare programs. </p>
      
<p> 
  In 1995, the government shut down when Congress could not agree on a budget.</p>
      <p> 
        In the <b>election of 1996</b>, Clinton beat Republican <u>Bob Dole</u>.&nbsp; 
        <u> Ross Perot</u>, the third party candidate, again finished third.</p>
      
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clinton 
  Again</strong></p>
<p>During 
  his second term, Clinton was more of a political moderate.</p>
<p>The 
  economy was booming in the late 1990s due to the Federal Reserve Board's low 
  interest rates and the growth of Internet business.</p>
<p><strong>The 
  North American Free Trade Agreement </strong>(<strong>NAFTA</strong>) was passed 
  in 1993, and it created a<strong> free-trade zone</strong> between Mexico, Canda, 
  and the United States. (It eliminated tariffs between the countries).</p>
<p>The 
  <strong>World Trade Organization</strong> (<strong>WTO</strong>) was created 
  in 1994, and it promoted trade between the participating countries. It was supported 
  by Clinton.</p>
<p>Clinton 
  fought for two domestic issues during his second term: the fight against <strong>tobacco 
  companies</strong> and the fight for<strong> gun control</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p> 
        <b>Problems Abroad</b></p>
      
<p> 
  Clinton struggled to develop an American foreign policy that wasn't centered 
  around fighting communism.</p>
<p>Clinton 
  sent troops to Somalia, but eventually withdrew them.&nbsp;Clinton initially 
  criticized China for its human rights abuses, but he eventually supported China 
  when he realized how important trade with China was to America.</p>
      
<p> 
  Clinton committed American troops to NATO to keep the peace in the former <b> 
  Yugoslavia</b>.</p>
<p>Clinton 
  led the 1993 reconciliation meeting between Israel's <u> Yitzhak Rabin</u> and 
  Palestinian <u>Yasir Arafat</u> at the White House.&nbsp; Two years later, though, 
  Rabin was assassinated, ending hopes for peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scandal 
  and Impeachment</strong></p>
<p>In 
  1998, it was discovered that President Clinton had an affair with a White House 
  intern, Monica Lewinsky (<strong>Lewinsky Affair</strong>). Clinton lied about 
  the affair under oath. The House Republicans passed two articles of <strong>impeachment</strong> 
  against Clinton: perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>In 
  1999, the Senate voted to remove Clinton from office, but the Republicans failed 
  to obtain the 2/3 majority that was required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clinton's 
  Legacy and the 2000 Election</strong></p>
<p>The 
  American economy prospered during Clinton's era in large part because of the 
  global economic expansion. </p>
<p>The 
  Democrats nominal <u>Albert Gore</u> for president and <u>Joseph Lieberman</u> 
  for vice president for the<strong> election of 2000</strong>. The Republicans 
  nominated <u>George W. Bush</u> for president and <u>Dick Cheney</u> for vice 
  president. Bush won nomination in large part because he was the son of former 
  president George H. W. Bush.</p>
<p>Bush 
  supported returning the federal budget surplus back to the people through tax 
  cuts and through giving money to private institutions who would help the poor. 
  Gore supported smaller tax cuts and strengthening Social Security.</p>
<p>The 
  election was very close and the electoral votes of <strong>Florida</strong> 
  would decide who won. For five weeks, it was uncertain who won Florida's ballots, 
  some of which were defective or unreadable. The Supreme Court eventually ruled 
  (on party lines) that <strong>Bush had won the presidency</strong>. Although 
  Bush won more electoral votes, <strong>Bush lost the popular vote</strong>. 
  (More people voted for Gore than for Bush.)</p>

<p><strong>Bush Begins</strong></p>
<p>Although 
  he entered office promising to be a uniter between the Democrats and Republicans, 
  President Bush was a <strong>very divisive president</strong>. He strongly opposed 
  welfare programs opposed environmentalist policies. He rejected the <strong>Kyoto 
  Treaty</strong>, which was an international treaty aimed at reducing greenhouse 
  gas emissions. He enacted large tax cuts that, along with upcoming wars, turned 
  a federal budget surplus into a massive budget deficit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Terrorism 
  Comes to America</strong></p>
<p>On 
  <strong>September 11, 2001</strong>, <strong>terrorists</strong> hijacked four 
  aircraft and crashed them into the World Trade Center Towers, the Pentagon, 
  and rural Pennsylvania. <strong>Al Qaeda</strong>, which was based in <strong>Afghanistan</strong> 
  and led by <u>Osama bin Laden</u>, was responsible for the attack.</p>
<p>In 
  October 2001, Congress passed the <strong>Patriot Act</strong>, which expanded 
  the government's ability to monitor citizens' communication, and it allowed 
  immigrants suspected of terrorism to be deported. In 2002, Congress created 
  the Department of Homeland Security which sought to protect the nation's borders. 
  Hundreds of immigrants were put into jail without formal charges.</p>
<p><strong>Guantanamo 
  Detection Camp</strong> was created on the American military base in Cuba to 
  hold captured Taliban fighters from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The 
  attacks on September 11th coincided with the beginning of an economic recession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bush 
  Takes the Offensive Against Iraq</strong></p>
<p>In 
  January 2002, Bush created the "<strong>axis of evil</strong>," which 
  included<strong> Iraq</strong>, <strong>North Korea</strong>, and <strong>Iran</strong>. 
</p>
<p>Hussein 
  had been harassing and dodging U.N. weapons inspectors for years. (Inspectors 
  were supposed to be allowed in the country after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.) 
  <strong>Bush was determined to invade Iraq and overthrow its dictator, Saddam 
  Hussein</strong> (finish the job that his dad had started). Bush made a variety 
  of false claims in his case for war against Iraq: Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; 
  Iraq could be a democratic beacon for the Middle East; Iraq supported Al Qaeda.</p>
<p>The 
  <strong>U.S. invaded Iraq </strong>on <strong>March 19, 2003</strong>. Britain 
  was America's only major ally in the invasion.<strong> </strong>Hussein was 
  quickly defeated. </p>
<p>On 
  May 1, 2003, Bush made a speech in which he claimed that major combat operations 
  in Iraq were complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Owning 
  Iraq</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sectarian 
  violence</strong> spread throughout Iraq as violence erupted between <strong>Sunni</strong> 
  and <strong>Shia</strong> Muslims. <strong>Sunnis</strong> were the <strong>minority</strong> 
  in Iraq that had power under Saddam. The <strong> Shia majority </strong>took 
  over after Saddam was overthrown. In retaliation for being displaced from power, 
  many Sunnis turned to bombings and political assassinations.</p>
<p>In 
  April, 2004, it was discovered that Iraqi prisoners were being tortured in <strong>Baghdad's 
  Abu Ghraib</strong> prison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reelecting 
  George W. Bush</strong></p>
<p>For 
  the election of 2004, the Republicans re-nominated Bush and the Democrats selected 
  <u>John F. Kerry</u>.</p>
<p>Bush 
  supported the <strong>No Child Left Behind Act</strong> of 2002, which mandated 
  sanctions against schools that failed to meet federal performance standards.</p>
<p>Bush 
  supported a constitutional amendment for banning gay marriage and he opposed 
  stem cell research.</p>
<p><strong>Bush 
  won the election of 2004</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bush's 
  Second Term</strong></p>
<p>Bush 
  appointed two new conservative justices to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In 
  2005, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff was convicted of perjury in 
  an investigation into who leaked the name of undercover CIA agent in retaliation 
  against her antiwar husband.</p>
<p>Also 
  in 2005, it was discovered that the government was <strong>illegally wiretapping</strong> 
  American citizens' communications.</p>
<p>The 
  Federal Emergency Management Agency (<strong>FEMA</strong>) responded poorly 
  to help New Orleans after <strong>Hurricane Katrina</strong> in 2005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Midterm 
  Elections of 2006</strong></p>
<p>Anti-Republican 
  sentiment helped Democrats win majorities in the House and Senate in the midterm 
  elections of 2006.</p>
<p>By 
  2005, most of the American public opposed the war in Iraq. By 2008, Bush's approval 
  rating was below 30%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The 
  Presidential Election of 2008</strong></p>
<p><u>Barack 
  Obama</u> beat Hillary Clinton to win the Democrat's presidential nomination 
  for the election of 2008. The Republicans nominated <u>John McCain</u> for president 
  and <u>Sarah Palin</u> for vice president. McCain had extensive experience in government, 
  while Palin had no experience and was not politically astute.</p>
<p>Another 
  <strong>recession</strong> hit the American economy in <strong>2008</strong>. 
  It was caused by a bursting<strong> housing bubble</strong> and the private 
  banking system's poor lending practices. Real estate prices and the stock market 
  plummeted. The federal government responded by taking over the country's two 
  biggest mortgage companies,<strong> Fannie Mae </strong>and <strong>Freddie Mac</strong>, 
  and by taking over the world's biggest insurance company, the <strong>American 
  International Group (AIG)</strong>. Congress also passed the <strong>Troubled 
  Assets Relief Program (TARP) </strong>to keep the nation's banks and businesses 
  afloat. </p>
<p><strong>Obama 
  won the election of 2008 </strong>by a large margin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Obama 
  in the White House</strong></p>
<p>To 
  jumpstart the economy, Obama supported the passage of the <strong>American Relief 
  and Recovery Act</strong>. This was an economic stimulus bill that was comprised 
  of tax cuts, spending for jobs programs, and funding for state and local governments.</p>
<p>The 
  economy started to recover from the "<strong>Great Recession</strong>" 
  by 2009.</p>
<p>Obama 
  supported a healthcare reform bill in 2010 called the <strong>Patient Protection 
  and Affordable Care Act</strong>. Most notably, this required all Americans 
  to buy health insurance and prohibited health insurers from denying coverage 
  to people with pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>In 
  2010, Obama signed the <strong>Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</strong>. 
  This overhauled the nation's financial regulatory system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A 
  Sea of Troubles</strong></p>
<p>The 
  "<strong>Tea Party</strong>" emerged in 2009 as a right-wing, ultra-Republican 
  party. They vehemently opposed most of Obama's policies.</p>
<p>In 
  2010, Obama helped repeal the military's "Don't Ask Don't Tell" policy 
  and he renewed a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wars, 
  Oil Spills, and Political Backlash</strong></p>
<p>By 
  2011, Obama had withdrawn all American combat troops from Iraq. Afghan insurgents 
  made Afghanistan very unstable and made it difficult for American troops to 
  leave.</p>
<p>On 
  April 20, 2010, BP's <strong>Deepwater Horizon oil platform </strong>exploded 
  in the Gulf of Mexico, pouring billions of gallons of oil into the Gulf. This 
  was the <strong>worst oil disaster </strong>in American history.</p>
<p><strong>Osama 
  bin Laden was killed </strong>by American forces in Pakistan in 2011.</p>

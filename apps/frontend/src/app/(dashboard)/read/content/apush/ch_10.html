      <p class="MsoNormal">Launching the New Ship of State</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">1789-1800</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Growing Pains</strong></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The American population was doubling every 25 years in the late 1700s. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Washington for President</strong></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">George Washington was unanimously elected as President 
        by the Electoral College in <b>1789</b>.&nbsp; He took the oath of office 
        on April 30, 1789.&nbsp; He established the cabinet.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Washington's cabinet consisted of: <u>Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson</u>, <u> Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton</u>, and<u> Secretary 
        of War Henry Knox.</u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bill of Rights</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>James Madison</u> wrote the <strong>Bill of Rights </strong>and 
        helped get them passed by Congress in <strong>1791.</strong></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>Judiciary Act of 1789</strong> created the the federal court system, including the Supreme 
        Court. It also created the office of attorney general.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><u>John Jay</u> became the first Chief Justice.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Hamilton Revives the Corpse of Public Credit</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Alexander Hamilton</u> set out to fix the financial system of America. One of his first objectives was to strengthen national credit. In this vein, he pushed for <strong>funding at par</strong>, which meant that the federal government would pay off its debts at face value plus interest. He also pushed for <strong>assumption</strong>, in which the federal government would pay states' debts.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">States 
        with large debts, like Massachusetts, accepted Hamilton's proposal, 
        but states with small debts, like Virginia, did not want the government 
        to assume state debts. &nbsp;Hamilton's plan was passed by Congress in 1790 in a deal that placed  the District of Columbia on the Potomac River (next to Virginia). </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Customs, Duties, and Excise Taxes</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hamilton believed that a <strong>national 
        debt</strong> was good for the country: the more creditors to whom the government owed 
        money, the more people there would be with a personal stake in the success 
        of the government.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hamilton supported the first tariff law<strong> (1789)</strong>, which imposed taxes on certain imports. This brought in much-needed revenue for the government&nbsp;and protected small American industries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In <strong>1791</strong>, Congress passed an <strong>excise tax</strong> on a few domestic items, including whiskey.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Hamilton Battles Jefferson for a Bank</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Alexander Hamilton proposed a <strong>Bank of the United 
        States</strong> that could print paper money and provide a stable national 
        currency.&nbsp; The national bank would also be a place where the Treasury 
        could deposit monies.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Thomas Jefferson strongly opposed the Bank stating 
        it was unconstitutional.&nbsp; He felt that the states had the right to 
        manage their own money.&nbsp; Most of the opposition came from the south 
        and most of the support came from the north.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Hamilton prevailed and the 1<sup>st</sup> Bank of the 
        United States was created in <b>1791</b>.&nbsp; Its charter lasted for 
        20 years and was located in Philadelphia. </p>
      
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Mutinous Moonshiners in Pennsylvania</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The <b>Whiskey Rebellion </b>in Pennsylvania in <b>1794</b> 
        was lead by distillers who strongly opposed the 1791 excise tax on whiskey.&nbsp; 
        The rebellion was ended when President Washington sent in federal troops.&nbsp; 
        Although the troops faced no opposition, a strong message was sent by 
        the government stating that it would enforce the law.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Emergence of Political Parties</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Political parties had not existed in America when George 
        Washington took office.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The personal feud between Thomas Jefferson 
        and Alexander Hamilton developed into a political 
        rivalry.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">In the 1790s, Jefferson and Madison organized their 
        opposition to the Hamiltonian program but confined it to Congress.&nbsp; 
        In due time, this organized opposition grew and the <b>two-party system</b> 
        emerged.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The Impact of the French Revolution</strong></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">When Washington's first administration had ended in 
        1793, a formation of two political groups had emerged: <strong>Jeffersonian 
          Democratic-Republicans </strong>and <strong>Hamilton Federalists.</strong></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans: supported states' rights and a smaller government</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hamilton Federalists: supported a powerful federal government </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>French Revolution</strong> started in <strong>1789 </strong>and eventually involved many European countries. It began peacefully but entered a violent phase when France declared war 
  on Austria in 1792.&nbsp; Things started to get worse when King Louis 
  XVI was beheaded in 1793, the church was attacked, and the head-rolling<strong> Reign of Terror</strong> was begun.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Washington's Neutrality Proclamation</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans wanted to <strong>support</strong> the French in their war against the British.  The 
        Federalists were <strong>opposed</strong>.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Washington issued the <strong>Neutrality Proclamation of 
        1793 </strong>stating the country's neutrality from the Britain-France war.&nbsp; 
        He was backed by Hamilton.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Embroilments with Britain</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">For years, the British had retained the frontier posts 
        on U.S. soil, all in defiance of the peace treaty of 1783.&nbsp; The London 
        government did not want to abandon the valuable fur trade in the Great 
        Lakes region, and British agents openly sold firearms to the <b>Miami 
        Confederacy</b>, an alliance of 8 Indian nations who terrorized Americans.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The Jeffersonians felt that American should again fight 
        Britain in defense of America's liberties.&nbsp; The Federalists opposed 
        this action because Hamilton's hopes for economic development depended 
        on trade with Britain.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Jay's Treaty and Washington's Farewell</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">In a last attempt to avoid war, President Washington 
        sent Chief Justice <u>John Jay</u> to London in <strong>1794</strong> to negotiate.&nbsp; 
        Opposed by Democratic-Republicans, Jay hammered out a treaty, <strong>Jay's 
          Treaty</strong>, in which the British promised to evacuate the chain of posts 
        on U.S. soil and pay for damages for the seizures of American ships.&nbsp; 
        Britain did not agree to anything about future maritime seizures 
        or about supplying arms to Indians.&nbsp; The treaty also called for the 
        U.S. to continue to pay the debts owed to British merchants on pre-Revolutionary 
        War accounts.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Jay's Treaty caused Spain, which feared an Anglo-American 
        alliance, to strike a deal with the U.S.&nbsp; In <b>Pinckney's Treaty 
        of 1795</b> with Spain, Spain granted the Americans free navigation of 
        the Mississippi River and the large disputed territory north of Florida.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">In his Farewell Address to the nation, Washington urged 
        against permanent alliances.&nbsp; He left office in <b>1797</b>.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>John Adams Becomes President</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><u>John Adams</u> (Washington's Vice President) beat Thomas Jefferson to become to 
        the <strong> 2<sup>nd</sup> President in 1797</strong>.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Hamilton became the leader of the <b>Federalist Party</b>, 
        known as the "High Federalists."</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Unofficial Fighting with France</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">France was upset with Jay's Treaty and it started capturing 
        American merchant ships.&nbsp; President John Adams sent <u>John Marshall</u> 
        to France to negotiate in <b>1797</b>.&nbsp; Hoping the meet <b>Talleyrand</b>, 
        the French foreign minister, Adams's envoy was secretly approached by 
        3 go-betweens, later referred to as X, Y, and Z (Mme de Villette, Jean 
        Conrad Hottinguer, and Lucien Hauteral).&nbsp; The French spokesmen demanded 
        a bribe of $250,000 just to talk to Talleyrand.&nbsp; Angered by the intolerable 
        terms, Marshall and the envoy returned to the U.S.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Infuriated with the <b>XYZ Affair</b>, America began 
        preparations for war:&nbsp; the Navy Department was created; the three-ship 
        navy was expanded; the United States Marine Corps was re-established. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Adams Puts Patriotism Above Party</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Because France did not want another enemy, it said 
        that if the Americans sent another negotiator minister, then he would 
        be received with proper respect.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><u>Napoleon Bonaparte</u> was the dictator of France.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Eager to free his hands of a potential enemy, Napoleon Bonaparte signed the <strong>Convention of 1800</strong> with 
        American representative <u>John Jay</u>.&nbsp; It annulled the alliance 
        between France and America that had existed since the Revolutionary War. The convention also 
        called for France to return captured American ships and for the U.S. to pay
        the damage claims of American shippers (damages were caused by France).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Federalist Witch Hunt</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">To decrease the number of pro-Jeffersonians, 
        the Federalist Congress passed a series of oppressive laws aimed at "aliens", 
        or foreigners who came to America and supported Jefferson.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">These <b>Alien</b> <b>Laws</b> raised the residence 
        requirements for aliens who desired to become citizens from 5 years to 
        14 years.&nbsp; They also stated that the President could deport or jail 
        foreigners in times of peace or hostilities.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The <b>Sedition Act</b> stated that anyone who impeded 
        the policies of the government or falsely defamed its officials would 
        be liable to a heavy fine and imprisonment.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Virginia (Madison) and Kentucky (Jefferson) 
        Resolutions</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Kentucky and Virginia passed resolutions that stated that the states had the right to refuse laws created 
        by the government. Virtually no other state followed the two states' 
        resolutions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Federalists versus Democratic-Republicans</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Hamilton Federalists supported a strong central government; 
        they believed that the government should support private enterprise, not 
        interfere with it; and they supported the British.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Jeffersonian anti-Federalists demanded a weak central 
        government and supported states' rights.</p>

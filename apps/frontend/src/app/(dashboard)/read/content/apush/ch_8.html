<p>The Second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in 1775. All 13 colonies were represented. The objective of the meeting was to draft a set of appeals to which the king would respond; independence was still not a widely accepted goal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Congress Drafts George Washington</strong></p>
<p>The Second Continental Congress selected <u>George 
  Washington</u> to lead the Continental army.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Bunker Hill and Hessian Hirelings</b></p>
<p>From April 1775 to July 1776, the colonists were mixed in their feelings for independence: some voiced a desire to mend differences, while others raised armies to fight the British.</p>
<p>In May 1775, a small American force lead by <u>Ethan Allen</u> and <u>Benedict Arnold</u> captured the British garrisons at <strong>Ticonderoga and 
  Crown Point</strong>.</p>
<p>In June 1775, the colonists captured <strong>Bunker Hill</strong>.&nbsp; 
  The British took it back, but they had heavily casualties.</p>
<p>In <strong>July 1775</strong>, the Second Continental Congress released the "<strong>Olive Branch Petition</strong>", which professed American loyalty to 
  the king and begged to the king to stop future hostilities.&nbsp; The petition was 
  rejected by the king.&nbsp; With the rejection, the Americans were forced to choose 
  to fight to become independent or to submit to British rule and power.</p>
<p>In August 1775, King George III proclaimed that the 
colonies were in rebellion.&nbsp; He then hired German <b>Hessians</b> to bring order 
to the colonies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Abortive Conquest of Canada</b></p>
<p>In October 1775, the <strong>British burned Falmouth </strong> (Portland), Maine.&nbsp; In the same month, colonists attacked Canada, hoping that they could add it as a 14th colony and remove it as a possible source for a British base.&nbsp; The attack failed when <u>General Richard Montgomery</u> was killed.</p>
<p>In January 1776, the <strong>British burned the town of Norfolk, Virginia</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Thomas Paine Preaches Common Sense</b></p>
<p>The Americans continued to <b>deny any intention of 
independence </b>because loyalty to the empire was deeply ingrained; many 
Americans continued to consider themselves apart of a transatlantic community in 
which the mother country of Britain played a leading role; colonial unity was 
poor; and open rebellion was dangerous.</p>
<p><u>Thomas Paine</u> released a pamphlet called <b><i>Common 
Sense</i></b> in <b>1776</b>.&nbsp; It argued that the colonies had outgrown any need 
for English domination and that they should be given independence.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Paine and the Idea of "Republicanism"</b></p>
<p>Thomas Paine called for the creation of a new kind of 
  political society, specifically a <strong>republic</strong>, where power flowed from the 
  people themselves. This was outlined in a pamphlet called the <strong><em>Common Sense</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Jefferson's Explanation of Independence</b></p>
<p>At the Second Continental Congress, <u>Richard Henry Lee</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>proposed that the colonies declare their independence.&nbsp;Thomas Jefferson was appointed to draft up the <strong>Declaration of Independence</strong>. The Declaration of Independence was formally <strong>approved</strong> by Congress on <strong>July 4, 1776</strong>. The "declaration" was more of an "explanation" of why the colonists sought their independence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Patriots and Loyalists</b></p>
<p>During the War of Independence, the Loyalists were called "<b>Tories</b>" 
and the Patriots were called "<b>Whigs</b>."&nbsp; </p>
<p>The American Revolution was a minority movement. Most colonists were apathetic or neutral. Patriot militias did a good job of winning the "hearts and minds" of the colonists. </p>
<p>The Loyalists made up just 16% of the American population.&nbsp; Many 
  educated and wealthy people remained loyal<strong> </strong> to England.&nbsp; Loyalists 
  were most numerous where the <strong>Anglican church </strong>was strongest.&nbsp; The <strong> Loyalists</strong> were well entrenched in <strong>New York City, Charleston, Quaker 
    Pennsylvania, </strong>and<strong> New Jersey</strong>.&nbsp; They were least numerous in New 
  England.</p>
<p>The <strong>Patriots </strong>were numerous where <strong>Presbyterianism 
  and Congregationalism </strong>flourished - mostly in New England.</p>

	  <p><b>The Loyalist Exodus</b></p>
<p>Before the Declaration of Independence, the Loyalists were 
  not extensively persecuted.&nbsp; After the declaration, though, they were subjected to more ridicule, hangings, and imprisonment.</p>
<p>Many Loyalists fled to the British lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>General Washington at Bay</b></p>
<p>The<strong> British</strong> concentrated their forces in <strong>New York City</strong> instead of Boston because Boston was evacuated in March 1776.</p>
<p>In <b>1776</b>, General Washington and his men were 
overpowered by the British at the <b>Battle of Long Island</b>.&nbsp; Washington and 
his men escaped to Manhattan Island.</p>
<p><u>General William Howe</u> was General Washington's 
adversary.</p>
<p>On <strong>December 26, 1776</strong>, Washington crossed the Delaware River to surprise and 
  capture <strong>1,000 Hessians </strong>in<strong> Trenton</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Burgoyne's Blundering Invasion</b></p>
<p>London officials developed a plan for capturing the 
  vital <strong>Hudson River valley in 1777</strong>. &nbsp;It would sever New England from the 
  rest of the states and paralyze the American cause.&nbsp; The main invading force, 
  lead by <u>General Burgoyne</u>, would push down towards Lake Champlain from 
  Canada.&nbsp; <u>General Howe's</u> troops in New York, if needed, could advance up 
  the Hudson River to meet Burgoyne near Albany.&nbsp; The third force was 
  commanded by colonel <u>Barry St. Leger</u>, who would come in from the west by 
  way of Lake Ontario and the Mohawk Valley.</p>
<p>General Burgoyne was forced to surrender his entire command 
  at <strong>Saratoga </strong>on<strong> October 17, 1777 </strong>to American general <u>Horatio 
    Gates</u> (<strong>Burgoyne's Blunder</strong>).&nbsp; This win made it possible for the Americans to recieve much-needed<strong> aid from France</strong>. (Turning point in war.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Revolution in Diplomacy?</b></p>
<p>The French wanted to support the American quest for independence in the hopes that they could destabilize the British empire. The Continental Congress drafted a <strong>Model Treaty</strong> which dictated that the Americans would only have a <strong>commercial</strong> trading connection with the French (i.e. no political or military connections).</p>
<p>The British offered the Americans <strong>home rule </strong>after 
  the British lost at the Battle of Saratoga. &nbsp;The French feared American-British reconciliation, so in <strong>1778</strong>, the <strong>French made an open alliance </strong>with the Americans. The French would join the fight against the British for American independence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Colonial War Becomes a World War</b></p>
<p>Spain and Holland became allied against Britain in <strong>1779</strong>. Catherine the Great of Russia lead the creation of the<strong> Armed Neutrality</strong>, which passively allied the remaining neutral European countries against Britain.</p>
<p>The British decided to evacuate Philadelphia and 
concentrate their strength in New York City.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Blow and Counterblow</b></p>
<p><u>General Benedict Arnold</u> turned a traitor against the 
  Americans in 1780.</p>
<p><u>General Nathaniel Greene</u> succeeded in clearing most 
British troops out of Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Land Frontier and the Sea Frontier</b></p>
<p>In <strong>1784</strong>, the Iroquois were forced to sign the<strong> Treaty of Fort Stanwix</strong>, which was the first 
  treaty between the United States and an Indian nation. They ceded most of their land to the Americans.</p>
<p><u>George Rogers Clark:</u> conceived the idea of capturing 
  the British forts located in the Illinois country in 1778-1779.</p>
<p><u>John Paul Jones</u> is known as the father of the navy.&nbsp; 
He employed the tactic of privateering.</p>
<p><strong>Privateering:</strong> when privately owned and crewed 
  vessels were authorized by a government during a wartime to attack and capture 
  enemy vessels, men, cargo, etc; it diverted the enemy's manpower from the main war effort; 
  it brought in needed gold, harassed the enemy, and raised American morale by 
  providing victories in a time when victories were few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Yorktown and the Final Curtain</b></p>
<p>From 1780-1781, the U.S. government was nearly bankrupt.</p>
<p><u>British General Cornwallis</u> retreated to the Chesapeake 
  Bay at <strong>Yorktown</strong> to await seaborne supplies and reinforcements. <u>Admiral de Grasse</u> joined the Americans in an assault 
  of Cornwallis via the sea.&nbsp; George Washington, along with <u>Rochambeau</u>'s French &nbsp;army and Admiral de Grasse, cornered Cornwallis.&nbsp; He was forced to <strong>surrender 
    on October 19, 1781</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Peace at Paris</b></p>
<p>In 1782, a Whig ministry (favorable to the Americans) replaced the Tory regime of Lord 
  North.</p>
<p><b>Conditions of the Treaty of Paris of 1783:</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- British formally recognized the 
independence of the United States.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- Florida is given to Spain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- The independent American now consisted of territory stretching to the Mississippi on the west, to the Great Lakes on the 
  north, and to Spanish Florida on the south.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- Yankees were to retain a share in the fisheries of Newfoundland.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- The Loyalists were to no longer be 
prosecuted.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">- Congress was to recommend to the 
  state legislatures that confiscated Loyalist property be restored.&nbsp;&nbsp; The states 
  vowed to put no lawful obstacles in the way of Loyalist property collection.</p>
<p><u>Ben Franklin</u>, <u>John Adams</u>, and <u>John Jay</u> 
negotiated the peace terms with Britain.</p>

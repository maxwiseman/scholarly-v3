<h4>American Life in the 17th Century</h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Unhealthy Chesapeake</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Half the people born in early Virginia and Maryland did not survive past age
  20 due to widespread disease.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  At the beginning of the 18<sup>th</sup> Century, <b> Virginia </b>was the
  <b>most populous </b>colony with 59,000 people.&nbsp; Maryland was the 3<sup
    >rd</sup
  >
  largest, after Massachusetts, with 30,000.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Tobacco Economy</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  By the <b>1630s, 1.5 million pounds of tobacco </b>were being shipped out of
  the Chesapeake Bay every year and almost 40 million by the end of the century.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Because of the massive amounts of tobacco crops planted by families, "<b
    >indentured servants</b
  >" were brought in from England to work on the farms.&nbsp; In exchange for
  working, they received transatlantic passage and eventual "<b>freedom dues</b
  >", including a few barrels of corn, a suit of clothes, and possibly a small
  piece of land.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Virginia and Maryland</b> employed the "<b>headright</b>" system to
  encourage the importation of servant workers.&nbsp; Under its terms, whoever
  paid the passage of a laborer received the right to acquire 50 acres of land.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Chesapeake planters brought some <b>100,000 indentured servants </b>to the
  region by <b>1700</b>.&nbsp; These "white slaves" represented more than
  <b>3/4 of all European immigrants </b>to Virginia and Maryland in the 17<sup
    >th</sup
  >
  Century.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Frustrated Freemen and Bacon's Rebellion</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1676</b>, about <b>1,000 Virginians</b>, led by a 29-year-old planter,
  <b><u>Nathaniel Bacon</u></b
  >, revolted against the Virginia government. They resented
  <u>Virginia's Governor William Berkeley</u> for his friendly policies towards
  the Indians.&nbsp; When Berkeley refused to retaliate for a series of savage
  Indian attacks on frontier settlements (due to his monopolization of the fur
  trading with them), the crowd attacked Indians and chased Berkeley from
  Jamestown, Virginia. They torched the capitol.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  During the civil war in Virginia, Bacon suddenly died from disease.&nbsp;
  Berkeley took advantage of this and crushed the uprising, hanging more than 20
  rebels.&nbsp; Charles II complained of the penalties dealt by Berkeley.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Due to the rebellions and tensions started by Bacon, planters looked for
  other, less troublesome laborers to work their tobacco plantations.&nbsp; They
  soon looked to Africa.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Colonial Slavery</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Africans</b> had been brought to <b>Jamestown</b> as early as <b>1619</b>,
  but as late as<b> 1670</b>, there were only about 2,000 in Virginia - about 7%
  of the total population of the South.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In the <b>1680s</b>, the <b>wages in England rose</b>, therefore decreasing
  the number of indentured servants coming to America.&nbsp; By the
  <b>mid-1680s</b>, <b>black slaves outnumbered white servants </b>among the
  plantation colonies' new arrivals.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1698</b>, the <b>Royal African Company</b>, first chartered in
  <b>1672</b>, <b>lost its monopoly </b>on carrying slaves to the
  colonies.&nbsp; Due to this, many Americans, including many Rhode Islanders,
  rushed to cash in on the slave trade.&nbsp; (Eventually, Rhode Island became
  the first state to abolish slavery.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Blacks accounted for half the population of Virginia by 1750.&nbsp; In South
  Carolina, they outnumbered whites 2:1.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Most of the slaves came from the west coast of Africa, especially stretching
  from present-day Senegal to Angola.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Starting in <b>1662</b>, Virginia enacted "<b>slave codes</b>" (laws) made
  blacks and their children the property of the white masters for life.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Africans in America</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  By about 1720, the proportion of females in the Chesapeake area soon began to
  rise, and the number of families increased.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  On the Sea Islands off South Carolina's coast, blacks evolved a language,
  <b><i>Gullah</i></b
  >.&nbsp; It blended English with several African languages, including Yoruba,
  Ibo, and Hausa.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>New York City in 1712</b>, a <b>slave revolt </b>killed 12 whites and
  caused the execution of 21 blacks.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1739 in South Carolina </b>along the Stono River, a revolt
  exploded.&nbsp; The rebels tried to march to Spanish Florida but were stopped
  by a local militia.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Southern Society</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Just before the Revolutionary War, <b>70% </b>of the <b> leaders</b> of the
  <b>Virginia legislature </b>came from families established in Virginia before
  1690.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Social Scale</b>:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  - <u>Planters</u>-owned gangs of slaves and vast domains of land; ruled the
  region's economy and monopolized political power.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  - <u>Small Farmers</u>-largest social group; tilled their own modest plots and
  may have owned one or two slaves.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  - <u>Landless Whites</u>-many were former indentured servants.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- <u>Black Slaves</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The New England Family</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In contrast with the Chesapeake, the New Englanders tended to migrate in
  families as opposed to single individuals.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Family came first with New Englanders.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  There were low premarital pregnancy rates, in contrast with the Chesapeake.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Because southern men frequently died young, leaving widows with small children
  to support,
  <b
    >the southern colonies generally allowed married women to retain a separate
    title their property and gave widows the right to inherit their husband's
    estates</b
  >.&nbsp; But in New England, Puritan lawmakers worried that recognizing
  women's separate property rights would undercut the unity of married persons
  by acknowledging conflicting interests between husband and wife.&nbsp;
  <b
    >When a man died in the North, the Church inherited the property, not the
    wife.</b
  >
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  New England women usually gave up their property rights when they married (to
  maintain the unity of marriage).&nbsp; In contrast to old England, the laws of
  New England made provisions for the property of widows and even extended
  important protections to women with marriage.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Above all, the laws of Puritan New England sought to defend the integrity of
  marriages.

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Life in the New England Towns</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Massachusetts was at the front of the colonies attempting to abolish black
  slavery.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  New towns were legally chartered by the colonial authorities, and the
  distribution of land was entrusted to proprietors.&nbsp; Every family received
  several parcels of land.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Towns of more than 50 families had to have an elementary school.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Just 8 years after<b> Massachusetts </b>was formed, the colony established
  <b>Harvard College, in 1636. </b>&nbsp;Virginia established its first college,
  <b>William and Mary, in 1693.</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Puritans ran their own churches, and democracy in Congregational Church
  government led logically to democracy in political government.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Half-Way Covenant and the Salem Witch Trials</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  About the middle of the 17<sup>th</sup> century, a new form of sermon began to
  be heard from Puritan pulpits - the "<b>jeremiad</b>."
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Troubled ministers in <b>1662 </b>announced a new formula for church
  membership, the <b>Half-Way Covenant</b>.&nbsp; This new arrangement modified
  the covenant, or the agreement between the church and its adherents, to admit
  to baptism-but not "full communion"-the unconverted children of existing
  members.&nbsp; This move increased the churches' memberships.&nbsp; This boost
  in aided the money-stricken church.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  A group of adolescent girls in <b>Salem, Massachusetts</b>, claimed to have
  been bewitched by certain older women.&nbsp; A witch hunt ensued, leading to
  the legal lynching of <b>20 women </b>in<b> 1692.</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1693,</b> the witchcraft hysteria ended when the governor of
  Massachusetts prohibited any further trials and pardoned those already
  convicted.&nbsp;
  <b>In 1713, the Massachusetts legislature annulled the "conviction</b>" of the
  "witches" and made reparation to their heirs.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The New England Way of Life</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <b>soil of New England was stony </b>and hard to plant with.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  There was <b>less diversity in New England than in the South </b>because
  European immigrants did not want to come to a place where there was bad
  soil.&nbsp; The summers in New England were very hot and the winters very
  cold.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Native Americans recognized their right to USE the land, but the concept
  of OWNING was unknown.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The people of New England became experts at shipbuilding and commerce due to
  the timber found in the dense forests.&nbsp; They also fished for
  <b>cod</b> off the coasts.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The combination of Calvinism, soil, and climate in New England made for
  energy, purposefulness, sternness, stubbornness, self-reliance, and
  resourcefulness.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Early Settlers' Days and Ways</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Women, slave or free, on southern plantations or northern farms, wove, cooked,
  cleaned, and care for children.&nbsp; Men cleared land; fenced, planted, and
  cropped the land; cut firewood; and butchered livestock as needed.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Resentment against upper-class pretensions helped to spark outbursts like
  <b>Bacon's Rebellion of 1676 in Virginia </b>and the
  <b
    >uprising of Maryland's Protestants toward the end of the 17<sup>th</sup>
    century.</b
  >&nbsp; In New York, animosity between lordly landholders and aspiring
  merchants fueled <b> Leisler's Rebellion</b>, an ill-starred and bloody
  insurgence that rocked <b>New York City from 1689-1691.</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In
  <b
    >1651, Massachusetts prohibited poorer folk from "wearing gold or silver
    lace</b
  ><strong>,"</strong> and in 18<sup>th</sup> century Virginia, a tailor was
  fined and jailed for arranging to race his horse-"a sport only for
  gentlemen."&nbsp;

<h3>Chapter 34</h3>
<h4>Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Shadow of War</h4>
<h4>1933-1941</h4>
<hr />
<p><b>The London Conference</b></p>
<p>
  In the summer of <b>1933</b>, 66 nations sent delegates to the
  <b>London Economic Conference</b>.&nbsp; The delegates hoped to coordinated an
  international response to the global depression. They wanted to stabilize
  currencies and the rates at which they could be exchanged.
</p>
<p>
  President Roosevelt opposed the conference because he did not want any
  interference with his own plans to fix the American economy.
</p>
<p>
  Without support from the United States, the London Economic Conference fell
  apart.&nbsp; The collapse strengthened the global trend towards nationalism,
  while making international cooperation increasingly difficult.
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Freedom for (from?) the Filipinos and Recognition for the Russians</b></p>
<p>
  Continuing the nation's isolationist policies, President Roosevelt withdrew
  from Asia.&nbsp;Congress passed the <b>Tydings-McDuffie Act</b> in
  <b> 1934</b>, providing independence to the Philippines by 1946. The nation
  did not want to have to support the Philippines if Japan attacked it.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1933</b>, Roosevelt formally recognized the <b>Soviet Union</b>, opening
  up trade and fostering a friendship to counter-balance the threat of German
  power in Europe and Japanese power in Asia.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Becoming a Good Neighbor</b></p>
<p>
  FDR started the <b>Good Neighbor policy</b>, in which America would not
  intervene or interfere with Latin American countries. All marines left
  <b>Haiti in 1934</b>. America also released some control over
  <b>Cuba </b>and<b> Panama.</b>
</p>
<p>
  When the <b>Mexican</b> <b>government</b> seized American oil properties in
  <b>1938</b>, President Roosevelt held to his unarmed intervention policy and a
  settlement was eventually worked out in <b>1941</b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Secretary Hull's Reciprocal Trade Agreements</b></p>
<p>
  Congress passed the <b>Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act</b> in <b>1934</b>,
  which was designed to lower the tariff. This act allowed the President to
  lower tariffs with a country if that country also lowered their tariffs.
  <u>Secretary of State Hull</u> succeeded in negotiating <b>pacts</b> with 21
  countries by the end of 1939.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The trade agreements dramatically increased U.S. foreign trade.&nbsp; The act
  paved the way for the American-led free-trade international economic system
  that took shape after WWII.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> Storm-Cellar Isolationism</b></p>
<p>
  Following the Great Depression, <strong>totalitarianism</strong> spread
  throughout Europe. <u>Joseph Stalin</u> took control of the Communist USSR and
  killed hundreds of thousands of political opponents.
  <u>Benito Mussolini</u> took control of Italy in 1922.
  <u>Adolf Hitler</u> took control of Germany in 1933.&nbsp; Hitler was the most
  dangerous of all of the dictators because he had tremendous power and he was
  impulsive.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1936</b>, Nazi Hitler and Fascist Mussolini allied themselves in the
  <b>Rome-Berlin Axis</b>.
</p>
<p>
  In 1934, <b>Japan</b> terminated the <b>Washington Naval Treaty</b> and
  accelerated their construction of large battleships.
</p>
<p>
  Mussolini, seeking power and glory in Africa, attacked <b> Ethiopia</b> in
  <b>1935</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Americans maintained an isolationist attitude because they thought that the
  oceans that surrounded the country would protect them.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1934</b>, Congress passed the <b>Johnson Debt Default Act</b>,
  preventing debt-dodging nations from borrowing further from the United States.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Congress Legislates Neutrality</b></p>
<p>
  Congress sought to keep America out of war by passing the
  <b>Neutrality Acts of</b> <b>1935</b>, <b>1936</b>, and <b>1937</b>.&nbsp; The
  acts stated that <i>when the president proclaimed</i> the existence of a
  foreign war, certain restrictions would automatically go into effect. In
  regards to countries that were involved in a war (victim or aggressor), no
  American could legally sail on one of their ships, sell or transport munitions
  to them, or give them loans.
</p>
<p>
  Because America did not help its democratic friends, America actually helped
  provoke the aggressors (because it did not deter them).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>America Dooms Loyalist Spain</b></p>
<p>
  The <b>Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939</b> started when Spanish rebels, led by
  fascist <u>General Francisco Franco</u>, rose against the left-wing republican
  government in Madrid. Aided by Mussolini and Hitler, Franco overthrew the
  <b>Loyalist regime</b>, which was supported by the Soviet Union. This war was
  a "<strong>dress rehearsal</strong>" for World War II because it involved many
  of the same countries.
</p>
<p>
  A small group of American volunteers (<strong>Abraham Lincoln Brigade</strong
  >) fought for the Loyalists.
</p>
<p>
  The United States wanted to stay out of war, so Congress amended the
  neutrality legislation to apply an arms embargo to both the Loyalists and
  rebels.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Appeasing Japan and Germany</b></p>
<p>
  In <b>1937</b>, the Japanese <b>invaded</b> <b>China</b>.&nbsp; President
  Roosevelt refused to call this invasion a "war", so the neutrality legislation
  did not take effect. If he had called it a war, he would have cut off munition
  sales to the Chinese. A consequence of this, though, was that the Japanese
  could still buy war supplies from the United States.
</p>
<p>
  FDR gave his <strong>Quarantine Speech</strong> in 1937, in which he proposed
  economic embargos against the aggressive dictators. The public opposed this,
  so FDR did not follow through with his plan.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1937</b>, Japanese planes sunk an American ship, the <b><i>Panay</i></b
  >. Tokyo quickly apologized and the United States accepted.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>1935</b>, Hitler <b>violated the Treaty of Versailles</b> when he
  introduced mandatory military service in Germany.&nbsp; In 1936, he again
  violated the treaty when he took over the demilitarized German Rhineland.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>March 1938</b>, Hitler invaded <b>Austria</b>.&nbsp; (Note: Austria
  actually voted for the occupation, fully aware that if it resisted, Germany
  would forcefully take over Austria.)
</p>
<p>
  At a <b>conference</b> in Munich, Germany in <b>September 1938</b>, the
  Western European democracies allowed Germany to keep <b>Sudetenland</b> (part
  of Czechoslovakia). They hoped that this would stop Hitler from taking over
  other countries. It did not.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>March 1939</b>, Hitler took over all of <b> Czechoslovakia</b>.&nbsp;
  (See Austria note.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Hitler's Belligerency and U.S. Neutrality</b></p>
<p>
  On <b>August 23, 1939</b>, the Soviet Union signed a nonaggression treaty with
  Hitler.&nbsp; The <b>Hitler-Stalin pact</b> meant that Germany could make war
  on Poland and the Western democracies without fear of retaliation from the
  Soviet Union.
</p>
<p>
  Hitler invaded Poland on <b>September 1, 1939</b>.&nbsp; Britain and France,
  honoring their commitments to Poland, declared war on Germany;
  <b>World War II</b> had started.
</p>
<p>
  Although Americans were strongly anti-Nazi, they wanted to stay out of the
  war.
</p>
<p>
  Britain and France needed war materials from America, so Congress passed the
  <b>Neutrality Act of 1939</b>. (The previous Neutrality Acts prohibited trade
  with them.) This new act let the European democracies buy American war
  materials as long as they transported the goods on their own ships and paid in
  cash. This allowed America to avoid loans, war debts, and the sinking of
  American ships.
</p>
<p>
  The demand for war goods helped end the recession of 1937-1938, and it solved
  the decade-long unemployment crisis.

<p><b>The Fall of France</b></p>
<p>
  The months after the fall of Poland were known as the "<b>phony</b>
  <b>war</b>" because France and the U.K. were not really militiarily involved
  in the war, yet.
</p>
<p>
  The Soviet Union took over <b>Finland</b> despite Congress loaning $30 million
  to Finland.
</p>
<p>
  The phoney war ended in April-May 1940 when Hitler took over<b> Denmark, </b
  ><b>Norway, </b>the <b>Netherlands,</b> and <b>Belgium</b>.
  <strong>France</strong> fell in <b>June 1940</b>.
</p>
<p>
  When France surrendered, Americans realized that England was all that stood in
  the way of Hitler controlling all of Europe. FDR and Congress quickly set out
  to build large airfleets and a two-ocean navy. On <b>September 6, 1940</b>,
  Congress passed a <b>conscription law</b>; under this measure, America's first
  peacetime <strong>draft</strong> was initiated.
</p>
<p>
  At the <b>Havana Conference of 1940</b>, the United States agreed to protect
  Latin America from German aggression (extension of the Monroe Doctrine).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Refugees from the Holocaust</strong></p>
<p>
  On November 9, 1938, mobs of Germans attacked German Jews (Kristallnact,
  "night of broken glass"). Following these attacks, thousands of Jews were sent
  to concentration camps.
</p>
<p>
  FDR created the <strong>War Refugee Board</strong> after learning of the Nazi
  genocide. It was created to help victims of the Nazis and other Axis powers.
</p>
<p>
  By the war's end, over <strong>6 millions Jews</strong> had been
  <strong>murdered</strong> in the <strong>Holocaust</strong>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Bolstering Britain</b></p>
<p>
  After France fell to Germany, Hitler launched air attacks against Britain in
  <b>August 1940</b> (<b>Battle of Britain</b>). During the Battle of Britain,
  radio broadcasts brought the drama from London air raids directly into America
  homes. Sympathy for Britain grew, but it was not yet sufficient to push the
  United States into war.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The most powerful group of those who supported aid for Britain was the
  <b>Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies</b>.&nbsp; Isolationists
  organized the <b>America First Committee</b>, contending that America should
  concentrate what strength it had to defend its own shores.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>September 2, 1940</b>, President Roosevelt transferred 50 destroyers
  left over from WWI to Britain.&nbsp; In return, Britain gave to the United
  States 8 valuable defensive base sites in the Western Hemisphere. This
  transfer of warships was a flagrant violation of America's neutrality
  obligations.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> Shattering the Two-Term Tradition</b></p>
<p>
  The Republicans chose <u>Wendell L. Willkie</u> to run in the election of
  1940. The Republicans condemned FDR's alleged dictatorship and they opposed
  the New Deal's inefficiencies.
</p>
<p>
  Roosevelt decided to run for a 3rd term, arguing that in a time of war, the
  country needed his experience. At this point, a 2-term presidential limit only
  existed in tradition.
</p>
<p>
  FDR won the <b>election of 1940</b>; voters generally felt that if war came,
  the experience of FDR was needed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A Landmark Lend-Lease Law</b></p>
<p>
  Fearing the collapse of Britain, Congress passed the
  <b> Lend-Lease Bill</b> in <b>1941</b>, under the pretense of defending
  America. It allowed America to <strong>lease</strong> arms to the democracies
  of the world that needed them.&nbsp;(Europeans didn't have the cash to buy the
  arms; cash was required by the Neutrality Act of 1939.) When the war was over,
  the guns and tanks could be returned.&nbsp; Opponents of the bill, like
  <u>Senator Taft</u>, criticized it, saying that the arms would be destroyed
  and unable to be returned after the war. It was pitched as a program that
  would allow the democracies to win the war and keep it away from America.
</p>
<p>The bill marked the abandonment of any pretense of neutrality.</p>
<p>
  Hitler saw the Lend-Lease Bill as an unofficial declaration of war. Until
  then, Germany had avoided attacking U.S. ships, but on <b>May 21, 1941</b>,
  the <b><i>Robin Moor</i></b
  >, an unarmed American merchantman, was destroyed by a German submarine in the
  South Atlantic, outside the war zone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> Charting a New World</b></p>
<p>
  Before the attack on Pearl Harbor, 2 events marked the course of WWII:
  <b>the fall of France in June 1940</b>, and
  <b>Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941</b>.
</p>
<p>Hitler decided to crush the Soviet Union</p>
<p>
  On <b>June 22, 1941</b>, Hitler <b>attacked</b> the <b>Soviet Union</b>. He
  hoped to take the oil and other resources of the Soviet Union and then
  concentrate on Britain. President Roosevelt sent military supplies to the
  USSR.
</p>
<p>
  In <b>August 1941</b>, Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill
  met and came up with the <b>eight-point Atlantic Charter</b> at the
  <b>Atlantic Conference</b>.<b> </b>It discussed the goals of the war. Among
  other things, it promised that there would be no territorial changes contrary
  to the wishes of the inhabitants; it affirmed the right of a people to choose
  their own form of government; and it declared for disarmament of the
  aggressors.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>U.S. Destroyers and Hitler's U-boats Clash</b></p>
<p>
  Because Germany kept sinking arms shipments, FDR decided to have American
  warships escort supplies to Britain (July 1941).
</p>
<p>
  After a series of American boats were sunk by German U-boats, Congress voted
  in <b>November 1941</b> to <b>repeal</b> the <b>Neutrality Act of 1939</b>.
  This enabled merchant ships to be legally armed and enter combat zones with
  munitions for Britain.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Surprise Assault on Pearl Harbor</b></p>
<p>Since September 1940, Japan had been allied with Germany.</p>
<p>
  Japan's war effort was dependent on trade with America. In late 1940, though,
  Washington imposed the first of its trade embargoes on Japan.&nbsp;The U.S.
  offered to lift the embargo if Japan ended its war with China. Japan did not
  agree to America's terms, and it continued to fight.
</p>
<p>
  On "Black Sunday" <b>December 7, 1941</b>, Japanese bombers attacked
  <b>Pearl Harbor</b>, killing 2,348 people. (<a
    href="http://www.usswestvirginia.org/ph/phlist.php"
    target="new"
    >List of those who died</a
  >) Most of America's battleships were significantly damaged, but its 3
  Pacific-fleet aircraft carriers were spared because they were out of the
  harbor.
</p>
<p>
  On <strong>December 8</strong>, the U.S. declared war on
  <strong>Japan</strong>. On <b>December 11, 1941</b>, Germany and Italy
  declared war on the U.S. The U.S. followed suit by declaring war on them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>America's Transformation from Bystander to Belligerent</b></p>
<p>
  Pearl Harbor united Americans in their desire to go to war. Prior to the
  attack, though, most Americans only supported <em>policies</em> that might
  lead to war. They did not want Britain to fall to Germany, and they wanted to
  stop Japan from expanding.

<h4>Manifest Destiny and Its Legacy</h4>
<h4>1841-1848</h4>
<hr />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Accession of "Tyler Too"</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  At the beginning of Henry Harrison's presidency,
  <u>Daniel Webster</u> (secretary of state) and <u>Henry Clay</u> (leader of
  Whigs in the Senate) expected to control the Presidency because Harrison was
  not a very commanding figure. Only 4 weeks into Harrison's presidency, though,
  Harrison died.&nbsp; This disrupted the plans of Webster and Clay.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>John Tyler:</u> Vice President to Henry Harrison; successor as President
  following Harrison's death; "Tyler too"; a Democrat at heart and contradicted
  many of the Whig Party's ideas.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>John Tyler:&nbsp; A President without a Party</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Whigs introduced many policy changes when the party won the presidency
  with Harrison (and then Tyler). The first change was
  <strong>financial reform</strong>.&nbsp; The independent treasury system was
  ended.&nbsp; A bill for a "<strong>Fiscal Bank</strong>," which would
  establish a new Bank of the United States went through Congress, but President
  Tyler vetoed it.&nbsp; The Whigs presented a "<strong
    >Fiscal Corporation,</strong
  >" but Tyler again vetoed it.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President Tyler was rejected by his former Whig Party.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Tyler reluctantly signed the <strong>Tariff of 1842</strong> because he
  recognized the government's need for revenue.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>A War of Words with Britain</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The 19<sup>th</sup> Century was marked by periods of public disdain for
  Britain.&nbsp; This sparked the "<strong>Third War with England</strong
  >."&nbsp; This war was only fought with editorials in papers.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1837</strong>, there was a small rebellion in Canada.&nbsp;
  Although it was supported by many Americans, the rebellion failed because it
  was backed by few Canadians.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1837</strong>, the American ship, the
  <strong><em>Caroline</em></strong
  >, was carrying military supplies to the rebelling Canadians when it was sunk
  by a British ship.&nbsp; Washington officials made ineffective protests
  against the attack.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1841</strong>, British officials in the Bahamas offered asylum to
  130 Virginia slaves who had rebelled and captured the American ship
  <strong> <em>Creole</em></strong
  >.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Manipulating the Maine Maps</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1842</strong>, the British wanted to build a road linking the
  seaport of Halifax to Quebec. The proposed road ran through disputed territory
  in northern Maine, though. Skirmishes between locals broke out and these
  skirmishes were referred to as the <strong>Aroostook War</strong>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  To prevent a wider-reaching war, the London Foreign Office sent
  <u>Lord Ashburton</u> to Washington to settle the dispute.&nbsp; He and Daniel
  Webster negotiated and agreed to a new boundary for Maine that put the
  disputed road in Canadian territory.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Lone Star of Texas Shines Alone</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In the 8 years following 1836, Mexico considered Texas one of their provinces
  that was in revolt. Mexico refused to recognize Texas's independence. Mexico
  threatened war if America protected Texas.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Texas made treaties with France, Holland, and Belgium.&nbsp; Britain was
  interested in seeing an independent Texas because they hoped it could be used
  to fragment and weaken America. The British were also interested in having
  Texas as a trading partner who was more friendly than the Americans.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Belated Texas Nuptials</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Texas was a leading issue in the presidential campaign of
  <strong>1844</strong>.&nbsp; The Democrats were pro-expansion and supported
  the annexation of Texas, while the Whigs were against it.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Democrats (James Polk) won the election of 1844, and lame duck (outgoing)
  President Tyler took that as a sign to acquire Texas before he left the
  presidency. He signed a resolution in <strong>1845</strong> that invited Texas
  to become the <strong>28<sup>th</sup></strong> state in America.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Oregon Fever Populates Oregon</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Four nations claimed parts of the <strong>Oregon Country</strong> at one time:
  <strong> Spain, Russia, Britain, </strong>and the<strong>
    United States</strong
  >.&nbsp; Spain gave up its American territory with the Florida Treaty of 1819,
  and Russia gave up its land with the treaties of 1824 and 1825.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Britain controlled the Oregon territory north of the Columbia River, while
  American controlled the southern territory. Britain had a smaller population
  in the Oregon territory, but it did not want to give up its claims.&nbsp; The
  disputed territory in the Oregon Country became an issue in the election of
  <strong>1844</strong>.

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>A Mandate (?) for Manifest Destiny</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  For the election of 1844, the Whigs chose <u>Henry Clay</u>, and the Democrats
  chose <u>James K. Polk</u>. Polk was the Speaker of the House of
  Representatives for four years and governor of Tennessee for two terms. He
  beat Henry Clay to win the <strong>election of 1844.</strong> He was known as
  "Young Hickory", he said he would protect Texas, and he avoided the issue of
  slavery.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In the 1840s and 1850s, the idea of <strong>Manifest Destiny</strong> spread
  across America. Many Americans felt that God had destined them to spread their
  democratic institutions over the entire continent and over South America as
  well.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Democrats strongly supported the idea of Manifest Destiny.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Polk the Purposeful</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Polk had four main goals for his presidency: 1) A lower tariff; 2) Restore the
  independent treasury, which the Whigs dropped in 1841 because the Whigs won
  the presidency; 3-4)&nbsp;The acquisition of California and the settlement of
  the Oregon Country dispute without violence.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>Robert J. Walker:</u> Secretary of Treasury to James Polk; devised the
  <strong>Walker Tariff of 1846</strong>, a tariff-for-revenue bill that reduced
  the tariff from 32% to 25%.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The independent treasury was restored in 1846.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Britain presented Polk with the Oregon Country up to the 49th parallel. This
  offer was approved without a shot fired.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Misunderstandings with Mexico</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The population of California in <b>1845 </b>consisted of Spanish-Mexicans and
  Indians.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Polk wanted to buy California (<b>The Bear Flag Republic</b>) from Mexico but
  relations with Mexico were poor due to the annexation of Texas.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>John Slidell:</u> sent by Polk to Mexico City in 1845 to buy California for
  $25 million; the offer was rejected.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>American Blood on American (?) Soil</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  On <strong>January 13, 1846</strong>, Polk ordered 4,000 men under
  <u> General Zachary Taylor</u> to the Rio Grande.&nbsp; On
  <strong>May 9, 1846</strong>, Polk asked Congress to
  <strong>declare war on Mexico</strong> of the basis of
  <strong>unpaid claims</strong> and<strong> Slidell's rejection</strong> of the
  purchasing of California. Prior to this request, Mexican troops had already
  attacked American troops. War was subsequently declared.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Many people in Congress accused Polk of provoking war. Mexico was not willing
  to sell California and war seemed to be the only way that America could get
  California.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Mastering of Mexico</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Polk wanted California, not war. He hoped that America could pull out of the
  war with California.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">American generals in Mexican-American War:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  - <u>General Stephen W. Kearny:</u> led 1,700 troops to Santa Fe.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  - <u>General Zachary Taylor:</u> won many victories including a victory over a
  large Mexican force at Buena Vista; future President
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px">
  - <u>General Winfield Scott:</u> succeeded in battling his way to Mexico City
  by September 1847; became President Abraham Lincoln's first choice to lead the
  Union army in the Civil War.
</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fighting Mexico for Peace</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>Nicholas P. Trist:</u> chief clerk of the State Department; signed the
  <strong>Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</strong> on
  <strong>February 2, 1848</strong>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ceded Texas and the area that included
  California to America for $15 million. This area was about half of Mexico. The
  antislavery Whigs in Congress ("Conscience Whigs") opposed the treaty because
  they had originally opposed the war. Expansionists also opposed the treaty
  because they wanted all of Mexico, not just part of it.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Profit and Loss in Mexico</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Mexican War provided field experience for the officers who became generals
  in the Civil War, including Captain Robert E. Lee and Lieutenant Ulysses S.
  Grant.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>David Wilmot:</u> proposed an amendment that stated that the territory from
  Mexico should remain slave-free. This <strong>Wilmot Proviso</strong> never
  passed the Senate because the Southern members did not want to remove the
  possibility of future slave states from this territory.

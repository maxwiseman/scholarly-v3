<h3>Chapter 26</h3>
<h4>The Great West and the Agricultural Revolution</h4>
<h4>1865-1896</h4>
<hr />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Clash of Cultures on the Plains</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In the West, soldiers spread cholera, typhoid, and smallpox to the
  Indians.&nbsp; They also reduced the bison population through hunting.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The federal government tried to appease the Plains Indians by signing treaties
  with the "chiefs" of various "tribes" at <strong>Fort Laramie</strong> in
  <strong>1851</strong> and at <strong>Fort Atkinson</strong> in
  <strong>1853</strong>.&nbsp; The treaties marked the beginning of the
  <strong>reservation system</strong> in the West.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Indians usually recognized no authority outside their own family; "tribes" and
  "chiefs" were fictitious names made up by white people.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In the 1860s, the government grouped the Plains Indians into smaller plots of
  land: mainly the "<strong>Great Sioux reservation</strong>" in Dakota
  Territory, and the <strong>Indian Territory</strong> in Oklahoma.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Receding Native Population</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  At <strong>Sand Creek, Colorado</strong> in <strong>1864</strong>,
  <u>Colonel J. M. Chivington's</u> militia killed 400 innocent Indians.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1866</strong>, a Sioux war party attacked and killed
  <u>Captain William J. Fetterman's</u> command of 81 soldiers and civilians in
  Wyoming's Bighorn Mountains.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>Battle of the Little Bighorn</strong> was a rare Indian victory in
  the plains wars.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1876</strong>, <u>Colonel George Armstrong Custer's</u> Seventh
  Cavalry was slaughtered as they tried to suppress the Indians after the Sioux
  attacked settlers who were searching for gold in the "Great Sioux
  reservation."
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>Nez Perc√© Indians</strong> were sent to a dusty reservation in
  Kansas in <strong>1877</strong>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The "taming" of Indians was accelerated by the railroad, white men's diseases,
  and alcohol.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bellowing Herds of Bison</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  After the Civil War, over 15 million <b>bison</b> grazed the western
  plains.&nbsp; By 1885, fewer than 1000 were left after the bison had been
  slaughtered for their tongues, hides, or for amusement.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The End of the Trail</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  By the 1880s, the nation began to realize the horrors it had committed on the
  Indians.&nbsp; <u>Helen Hunt Jackson</u> published
  <strong><em>A Century of Dishonor</em></strong> in <strong>1881</strong> which
  told of the record of government ruthlessness in dealing with the
  Indians.&nbsp; She also wrote <strong><em> Ramona</em></strong> in
  <strong>1884</strong> which told of injustice to the California Indians.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <b>Dawes Severalty Act of 1887</b> dissolved many tribes as legal
  entities, wiped out tribal ownership of land, and set up individual Indian
  family heads with 160 free acres.&nbsp; If the Indians behaved like "good
  white settlers" then they would get full title to their holdings as well as
  citizenship.&nbsp; The Dawes Act attempted to assimilate the Indians with the
  white men.&nbsp; The Dawes Act remained the basis of the government's official
  Indian policy until the <b>Indian Reorganization Act of 1934</b>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <b>1879</b>, the government funded the <b>Carlisle Indian School</b> in
  Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Mining:&nbsp; From Dishpan to Ore Breaker</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1858</strong>, minerals including <strong>gold</strong> and
  <strong> silver</strong> were discovered in the Rockies, prompting many
  "<strong>fifty-niners</strong>" or "<strong>Pike's Peakers</strong>" to rush
  to the mountains in search of the precious metals.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  "Fifty niners" also rushed to Nevada in <strong>1859</strong> after gold and
  silver were discovered at Comstock Lode.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Women gained the right to vote in Wyoming (1869), Utah (1870), Colorado
  (1893), and Idaho (1896), long before the women of the East.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Frontier mining played a vital role in bringing people and wealth to the
  West.&nbsp; The discoveries of gold and silver also allowed the Treasury to
  resume specie payments in <strong>1879 </strong>(payments for silver).
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Beef Bonanzas and the Long Drive</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Transcontinental railroads enabled live cattle to be transported to the East
  from Texas. The cattle were butchered once they arrived in an Eastern city.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Cattle-raisers organized the
  <strong>Wyoming Stock-Growers' Association</strong> to make the cattle-raising
  business profitable.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Farmer's Frontier</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>Homestead Act of 1862</strong> allowed a settler to acquire as
  much as 160 acres of land by living on it for 5 years, improving it, and
  paying a nominal fee of about $30.&nbsp; Instead of public land being sold
  primarily for revenue, it was now being given away to encourage settlement of
  empty spaces and to provide a stimulus to the family farm.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Much of the land given away by the Act had terrible soil and the weather
  included no precipitation.&nbsp; Many homesteaders were forced to give their
  homesteads back to the government.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>100th meridian</strong> was an imaginary line running from the
  Dakotas to Texas that separated the wet East from the dry West.
  <strong>"Dry farming</strong>" was the practice of using shallow cultivation
  to grow crops in the dry western environment. Over time, it depleted and dried
  the soil.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Tough strains of wheat flourished in the West, and new federally-financed
  irrigation projects caused the Great American Desert to bloom.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Far West Comes of Age</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The West experienced tremendous population growth from the 1870s to the
  1890s.&nbsp; Colorado was admitted as a state in 1876 after the Pike's Peak
  gold rush.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  From 1889-1890, the Republican Congress, seeking more Republican electoral and
  congressional votes, admitted six new states:&nbsp; ND, SD, MT, WA, ID, and
  WY.&nbsp; Utah was admitted in 1896, after the Mormon Church formally banned
  polygamy in 1890.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Many "<strong>sooners</strong>" illegally entered the Indian lands in the
  district of Oklahoma.&nbsp; On April 22, 1889, the district was opened to the
  public and thousands came.&nbsp; In 1907, Oklahoma was admitted as the
  "<strong>Sooner State</strong>."

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Fading Frontier</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In <strong>1890</strong>, an American <strong>frontier line</strong> was no
  longer evident; all the unsettled areas were now broken up by isolated bodies
  of settlement.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Western migration may have caused urban employers to maintain high wages to
  discourage workers from leaving to go farm the West.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Western cities grew as failed farmers, failed miners, and unhappy easterners
  sought fortune in cities.&nbsp; By <strong>1880</strong>, the area from the
  Rockies to the Pacific Coast was the most urbanized region in America,
  measured by the percentage of people living in cities.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Farm Becomes a Factory</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  High prices caused farmers to concentrate on growing single
  "<strong>cash</strong>"<strong> crops</strong>, such as
  <strong>wheat</strong> or <strong>corn</strong>, and use their profits to buy
  produce at the general store and manufactured goods in town.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The speed of harvesting wheat dramatically increased in the 1870s by the
  invention of the <strong>twine binder</strong> and the in the 1880s by the
  <strong> combine</strong>.&nbsp;This
  <strong>mechanization of farms</strong> brought about the idea that farms were
  "outdoor grain factories."
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Deflation Dooms the Debtor</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Because Western farmers grew single crops (wheat or corn), they existed in a
  <strong>one-crop economy</strong>, like the southern cotton farmers.
  &nbsp;Farmers' livelihoods depended on the price of their single product,
  which was unpredictable and out of their control.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In the late 1800s, <strong>deflation</strong> caused the relative prices of
  crops to decrease. Thousands of farms foreclosed, and some farmers became
  <strong>tenant farmers</strong>, renting instead of owning the land that they
  farmed.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Unhappy Farmers</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In the late 1800s, poor soil and <strong>droughts</strong> forced many people
  to abandon their farms and towns.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Farmers sold their produce in an <strong>unprotected world market</strong>,
  but they had to buy their manufactured equipment in a
  <strong>tariff-protected home market</strong>.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Farmers were at the mercy of various corporations: harvester trust, the
  barbed-wire trust, the fertilizer trust, railroad trust.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Farmers made up half the population in 1890, but they failed to organize until
  they were forced to do so by the federal government 50 years later.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Farmers Take Their Stand</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry </strong> (also known
  as the Grange), organized in <strong>1867</strong>, was led by
  <u>Oliver H. Kelley</u>.&nbsp; Kelley's first objective was to enhance the
  lives of isolated farmers through social, educational, and fraternal
  activities.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Grangers also sought to improve the farmers' collective troubles.&nbsp;
  They established cooperatively owned stores for consumers and cooperatively
  owned grain elevators and warehouses for producers.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Some Grangers entered politics and made <strong>Grange Laws</strong>, which
  tried to force public control of private business for the general
  welfare.&nbsp; The Grangers' influence faded after courts reversed their laws.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>Greenback Labor Party</strong> sought to improve the working
  conditions of laborors.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Prelude to Populism</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Farmers formed the <strong>Farmers' Alliance</strong> in the late 1870s. They
  cooperated in buying and selling&nbsp;to gain control over the railroads and
  manufacturers.&nbsp;The Alliance had limited power because it excluded blacks
  and landless tenant farmers. The
  <strong>Colored Farmers' National Alliance </strong>was formed in the 1880s to
  attract black farmers.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>People's Party</strong>, also known as the
  <strong>Populists</strong>, grew out of the Farmers' Alliance.&nbsp; It called
  for nationalizing the railroads, telephones, and telegraph; instituting a
  graduated income tax; and creating a new federal <strong>subtreasury</strong>,
  in which harvested crops were stored until crop prices rose. Populists also
  wanted free and unlimited coinage of silver.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Coxey's Army and the Pullman Strike</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>panic of 1893</strong> strengthened the Populists' stance that
  farmers and laborers were being oppressed by the economic and political
  systems.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>"General" Jacob S. Coxey</u> led a protest in Washington in 1894, demanding
  that the government start a public works program.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <u>Eugene V. Debs</u> helped to organize the
  <strong>American Railway Union</strong>.&nbsp; The
  <strong>Pullman strike of 1894</strong> was started when the Pullman Palace
  Car Company cut wages. &nbsp;Federal troops broke up the strike.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Golden McKinley and Silver Bryan</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Republican candidate for the <strong>election</strong>
  <strong>of</strong> <strong>1896</strong> was <u>William McKinley</u>.&nbsp;
  <u>Marcus Alonzo Hanna</u> was McKinley's influential campaign manager.&nbsp;
  Hanna felt that the prime function of government was to aid business, and he
  believed in the "<strong>trickle down effect"</strong> (laborers do well if
  the business does well). The Republican platform supported the gold standard.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Democratic candidate was <u>William Jennings Bryan</u>.&nbsp; He supported
  inflation through the unlimited coinage of silver, which caused many Populists
  to support him as a candidate.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Class Conflict:&nbsp; Plowholders versus Bondholders</b>
</p>
<p>
  William McKinley won the election of 1896.&nbsp; Many of McKinley's votes came
  from the East.&nbsp; Many of Bryan's votes came from the debt-stricken South
  and the trans-Mississippi West.&nbsp; Businesses and wage earners in the East
  voted for their jobs and had no reason to favor inflation, which was the heart
  of Bryan's campaign.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The election of 1896 was the last election in which a candidate tried to win
  the election with help from the farmers. There were more people in cities, so
  future elections focused on trying to win the urban vote.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The political era from 1896 to 1932 was called the "<strong
    >fourth party system</strong
  >." This time period was characterized by lower voter turnout, weakening of
  party organizations, and the fading of issues like civil-service reform. New
  political issues became concern for industrial regulation and the welfare of
  labor.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Republican Stand-pattism Enthroned</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>Dingley Tariff Bill</strong>, passed in <strong>1897</strong>,
  instituted high tariff rates to generate revenue to cover the annual Treasury
  deficits.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Republicans claimed credit for bringing prosperity to the
  nation&nbsp;following the panic of 1893.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The <strong>Gold Standard Act of 1900</strong> allowed for paper currency to
  be redeemed for gold.
